# Introduction

More than a decade ago, Bitcoin [[Nakamoto08]](#references)
swept the computer industry
as a revolution, providing, for the first time, a reliable technology
for building trust over an inherently untrusted computing
infrastructure, such as a distributed network of computers.
Trust immediately translated into money and Bitcoin became
an investment target, exactly at the moment of one of the worst
economical turmoil of recent times. Central(-_ized_) banks,
fighting against the crisis, looked like dinosaurs in comparison
to the _decentralized_ nature of Bitcoin.

Nevertheless, the novelty of Bitcoin was mainly related to its
_consensus_ mechanism based on a _proof of work_, while the
programmability of Bitcoin transactions was limited due
to the use of a non-Turing-equivalent scripting
bytecode [[Antonopoulos17]](#references).

The next step was hence the use of a Turing-equivalent
programming language (up to _gas limits_) over an abstract
store of key/value pairs, that can be
efficiently kept in a Merkle-Patricia trie.
That was Ethereum [[AntonopoulosW19]](#references), whose
Solidity programming language allows one
to code any form of _smart contract_, that is, code
that becomes an agreement between parties, thanks to
the underlying consensus enforced by the blockchain.

Solidity looks familiar to most programmers. Conditionals, loops and
structures are there since more than half a century. Programmers
assumed that they _knew_ Solidity. However, the intricacies of
its semantics made learning Solidity harder than expected.
Finding good Solidity programmers is still difficult and
they are consequently expensive. It is, instead, way too easy
to write buggy code in Solidity, that _seems_ to work perfectly,
up to _that_ day when things go wrong, very wrong [[AtzeiBC17]](#references).

It is ungenerous to blame Solidity for all recent attacks to smart contracts
in blockchain. That mainly happened because of the same success of Solidity,
that made it the natural target of the attacks. Moreover, once the
Pandora's box of Turing equivalence has been opened, you cannot expect anymore to
keep the devils at bay, that is, to be able to
decide and understand, exactly, what your code will do at run time.
And this holds for every programming language, past, present or future.

I must confess that my first encounter with Solidity
was a source of frustration. Why was I expected to learn another programming
language? and another development environment? and another testing framework?
Why was I expected to write code without a support library that provides
proved solutions to frequent problems?
What was so special with Solidity after all? Things became even more difficult when
I tried to understand the semantics of the language. After twenty-five years of studying
and teaching programming languages, compilation, semantics and code analysis
(or, possibly, just because of that) I still cannot explain exactly why there
are structures and contracts instead of a single composition mechanism in Solidity;
nor what is indeed the meaning of `memory` and `storage` and why
it is not the compiler that takes care of such gritty details; nor why
externally owned accounts are not just a special kind of contracts;
nor why Solidity needs such low-level (and uncontrollable)
call instructions, that make Java's (horrible) reflection, in comparison, look like
a monument to clarity;
nor why types are weak in Solidity, so that contracts are held in `address`
variables, whose actual type is unknown and cannot be easily
enforced at run time [[CrafaPZ19]](#references), with all consequent
programming monsters, such as unchecked casts. It seems that the evolution
of programming languages has brought us back to C's `void*` type.

Hence, when I first met people from Ailia SA in fall 2018, I was not surprised
to realize that they were looking for a new way of programming smart contracts
over the new blockchain that they were developing. I must thank them and our useful
discussions, that pushed me to dive in blockchain technology and
study many programming languages for smart contracts. The result
is Takamaka, a Java framework for writing smart contracts.
This means that it allows programmers to use a subset of Java for writing code
that can be installed and run in blockchain. Programmers will not have
to deal with the storage of objects in blockchain: this is completely
transparent to them. This makes Takamaka completely different from other
attempts at using Java for writing smart contracts, where programmers
must use explicit method calls to persist data to blockchain.

Writing smart contracts in Java entails that programmers
do not have to learn yet another programming language.
Moreover, they can use a well-understood and stable development
platform, together with all its modern tools. Programmers can use
features from the latest versions of Java, such as streams and lambda
expressions.
There are, of course, limitations to the kind of code that can
be run inside a blockchain. The most important limitation is
that programmers can only call a portion of the huge Java library,
whose behavior is deterministic and whose methods are guaranteed
to terminate.

The runtime of the Takamaka programming language
is included in the Hotmoka project, a framework
for collaborating nodes, whose long-term goal is to unify the programming
model of blockchain and internet of things.
The more scientific aspects of Hotmoka and Takamaka have been published
in the last years [[BeniniGMS21]](#references)[[CrosaraOST21]](#references)[[OlivieriST21]](#references)[[Spoto19]](#references)[[Spoto20]](#references).

**Intended Audience**.
This book is for software developers who want to use Hotmoka nodes and program smart contracts in Takamaka.
It goes deep into the inner working of Hotmoka. For instance, it shows how transactions can be
triggered in code, not just with the Moka client of Hotmoka. Less experienced readers, or
developers not interested in writing code that interacts with Hotmoka nodes, can just skip these
parts and concentrate on the use of the Moka command-line client only. Non-technical users might
just be happy with the use of Mokito and Hotwallet, the mobile and web clients of Hotmoka, whose
functionalities are of course limited.

**Contribute to Hotmoka**.
Hotmoka is a complex project, that requires many and different skills. After years of development,
it is ready for the general public. This does not mean that it is bug-free, nor perfect:
we expect our users to find all sort of bugs and to suggest improvements. Hence, feel
free to write to us at `info@hotmoka.io`, with bugs and improvement requests.
If you are a developer, consider the possibility of helping us with the development
of the project. In particular, the whole ecosystem of applications running
over Hotmoka is missing at the moment (that is, applications, typically web-based, that
use Hotmoka as their backend storage). Hotmoka is open-source and non-proprietary,
licensed under the terms of the Apache 2.0 License. Therefore, feel free to clone and fork the code.

**The Example Projects of This Book**.
The experiments that we will perform in this book will
require one to create Java projects inside a directory that we will name
`hotmoka_tutorial`. We suggest that you create and
experiment with these projects yourself.
However, if you have no time and want to jump immediately to the result,
or if you want to compare your work
with the expected result, we provide you with the completed examples of this book in
a repository that you can clone.
Each section of this book will report
the project of the repository where you can find the related code.
You can clone that completed tutorial examples repository as follows:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Hotmoka/hotmoka_tutorial.git
```

This will create the `hotmoka_tutorial` directory. Inside that directory, you will
find the Java projects of this book, in Maven format.
You can import all these projects into Eclipse (File &rarr; Import; then specify
*Existing Maven Projects* and finally select the `hotmoka_tutorial` directory).
They can be imported similarly in IntelliJ and NetBeans.

# Getting Started with Hotmoka

## Hotmoka in a Nutshell

Hotmoka is the abstract definition of a device that can store
objects (data structures) in its persistent memory (its _state_)
and can execute, on those objects,
code written in a subset of Java called Takamaka. Such a device is
called a _Hotmoka node_ and such programs are known as
_smart contracts_, taking that terminology from programs that run inside
a blockchain. It is well true that Hotmoka nodes can be different from the nodes
of a blockchain (for instance, they can be an Internet of Things device);
however, the most prominent application of Hotmoka nodes is, at the
moment, the construction of blockchains whose nodes are Hotmoka nodes.

Every Hotmoka node has its own persistent state, that contains code and
objects. Since Hotmoka nodes are made for running Java code, the code
inside their state is kept in the standard jar format used by Java, while objects
are just a collection of values for their fields, with a class tag that identifies
whose class they belong too and a reference (the _classpath_)
to the jar where that class is defined.
While a device of a Internet of Thing network is the sole responsible
for its own state, things are different if a Hotmoka node that is part of a blockchain.
There, the state is synchronized and identical across all nodes of the blockchain.

In object-oriented programming, the units of code that can be run
on an object are called _methods_.
When a method must be run on an object,
that object is identified as the _receiver_ of the execution of the method.
The same happens in Hotmoka. That is, when one wants to run a method
on an object, that object must have been already allocated
in the state of the node and must be marked as the receiver of the execution
of the method. Assume for instance that one wants to run a method
on the object in Figure @fig:receiver_payer, identified as receiver.
The code of the method is contained in a jar, previously installed in the state
of the node, and referred as _classpath_. This is the jar where the class of
the receiver is defined.

Receiver, payer and classpath for a method call in a Hotmoka node"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:receiver_payer. Receiver, payer and classpath for a method call in a Hotmoka node.</p>

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:receiver_payer. Receiver, payer and classpath for a method call in a Hotmoka node.](pics/receiver_payer.png "Figure @fig:receiver_payer. Receiver, payer and classpath for a method call in a Hotmoka node."){ width=55% }

The main difference with standard object-oriented programming is that Hotmoka requires one
to specify a further object, called _payer_. This is because a Hotmoka node is
a public service, that can be used by everyone has an internet connection
that can reach the node. Therefore, that service must be paid with the
internal cryptocurrency of the node, by providing a measure of execution
effort known as _gas_. The payer is therefore a sort of bank account, whose
balance gets decreased in order to pay for the gas needed for the execution of the method.
The payer is accessible inside the method as its _caller_.

> More importantly, Hotmoka keeps an explicit class tag inside the objects,

> and are referenced through the untyped `address` type.

Receiver and payer have different roles but are treated identically in Hotmoka:
they are objects stored in state at their respective state locations, known as
their _storage references_. For instance the caller in
Figure @fig:receiver_payer might be allocated at the storage
reference `@account1`. A storage reference has two parts, separated
by a `#` sign. The first part are 64 hexadecimal digits (ie, 32 bytes)
that identify the
transaction that created the object; the second part is a progressive number
that identifies an object created during that transaction: the first object
created during the transaction has progressive zero, the second has progressive
one, and so on. When a method is called on a Hotmoka node, what is actually specified
in the call request are the storage references of the receiver and of the payer
(plus the actual arguments to the method, if any).

In Hotmoka, a _transaction_ is either

1. the installation of a jar, that modifies the state of the node, and is paid by a payer account, or
2. the execution of a method on a receiver, that yields a returned
   value and/or has side-effects that modify the state of the node, and is paid by a payer account.

A Hotmoka node can keep track
of the transactions that it has executed, so that it is possible, for instance,
to recreate its state by running all the transactions executed in the past, starting from
the empty state.

It is very important to discuss at this moment a significant difference with what
happens in Bitcoin, Ethereum and most other blockchains. There, an account
is not an object, nor a contract,
but just a key in the key/value store of the blockchain, whose value is its balance.
The key used for an account is typically computed by hashing the public key derived from
the private key of the account. In some sense, accounts, in those blockchain, exist
independently from the state of the blockchain and can be computed offline: just
create a random private key, compute the associated public key and hence its hash.
Hotmoka is radically different: an account is an object that must be allocated in
state by an explicit transaction (that must be paid, as every transaction).
The public key is explicitly stored inside the object
(Base64-encoded in its `publicKey` field, see Figure @fig:receiver_payer).
That public key was passed as a parameter for the creation of the payer object and
can be passed again for creating more accounts. That is, it is well possible, in Hotmoka,
to have more accounts in the state of a node, all distinct, but controlled by the same key.

This has a major consequence. In Bitcoin and Ethereum, an account is identified by
twelve words and a password, by using the BIP39 encoding
(see Figure 5-6 of [[Antonopoulos17]](#references)). These twelve words are just
a mnemonic representation of 132 bits: 128 bits for the random entropy used to derive the
private key of the account and four bits of checksum. In Hotmoka, these 128 bits are
not enough, since they identify the key of the account but not the 32 bytes of its
storage reference (in this representation, the progressive is assumed to be zero).
As a consequence, accounts in Hotmoka are identified by
128+256 bits, plus 12 bits of checksum (and a password), which give rise to 36 words with the BIP39 encoding.
By specifying those 36 words across different clients, one can control the
same account with all such clients. As usual, those 36 words must be stored in paper
and kept in a secure place, since losing them amounts to losing access to the account.

As shown in Figure @fig:receiver_payer, the code of the objects (contracts) installed in
the state of a Hotmoka node consists in jars (Java archives) written in a subset of Java
known as Takamaka. This is done in a way completely different from other blockchains:

1. In Hotmoka, programmers code the contracts that want to install in the node and nothing more;
   they do _not_ program the encoding of data into the key/value store of the node (its _keeper_,
   as it is called in other blockchains); they do _not_ program the gas metering; they do _not_
   program the authentication of the accounts and the verification of their credentials.
   Everything is automatic in Hotmoka, exactly as in Ethereum, and differently from other blockchains
   that use general purpose languages such as Java for their smart contracts: there, programmers
   must take care of all these details, which is difficult, boring and error-prone. If this is done
   incorrectly, those blockchains will hang.
2. In Hotmoka, the code installed in the node passes a preliminary verification, that checks the correct
   use of some primitives, that we will introduce in the subsequent chapters, and guarantees that the
   code is deterministic. This excludes an array of errors in Hotmoka, while other blockchains
   will hang if, for instance, the code is non-deterministic.

## Hotmoka Clients

In order to query a Hotmoka node, handle accounts and run transactions on the node,
one needs a client application. Currently, there are a command-line client, called
Moka, a mobile client for Android, called Mokito, and a web client that gets installed
in the browser (Chrome or Firefox), called Hotwallet. Mokito and Hotwallet provide
basic functionalities only (handling accounts, querying the state of the objects in the node,
running simple transactions), while Moka is the most complete solution, but also the
most difficult to use.

### Moka

You can use the `moka` tool to interact with a Hotmoka node,
install code in the node and run transactions in the node.
The latest version of the tool can be downloaded from
[https://github.com/Hotmoka/hotmoka/releases](https://github.com/Hotmoka/hotmoka/releases).
Its source code is maintained inside the main distribution of the Hotmoka project, at
[https://github.com/Hotmoka/hotmoka](https://github.com/Hotmoka/hotmoka), in the submodule
`io-hotmoka-tools`.
We report below the installation instructions of `moka`.
In order to run the tool, you need Java JDK version 11 (or higher) installed in your
computer and a recent version of Maven.

#### Linux and MacOS

You should download and untar the latest release into the directory
where you want to install `moka`. For instance, assuming that
the latest version is `@hotmoka_version` and that
you want to install it under `~/Opt/moka`, you can run the following commands:

````shell
$ cd ~/Opt
$ mkdir moka
$ cd moka
$ wget https://github.com/Hotmoka/hotmoka/releases/
     download/v@hotmoka_version/moka_@hotmoka_version.tar.gz
$ tar zxf moka_@hotmoka_version.tar.gz
$ export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)
````

> The dollar sign is the prompt of the shell.
> In the shell scripts reported in this book, whenever a line is too long,
> as that starting with wget above, we go to the next line but you should enter
> the command in a single line, without newlines or spaces: `...releases/download/v...`

The last `export` command expands the command-path of the shell with
the `~/Opt/moka` directory, so that `moka` can
be invoked from the command shell, regardless of the current directory.
You might want to add an `export`
at the end of your `~/.bashrc` configuration file, so that the command-path
will be expanded correctly the next time you open a shell. For instance, I added
the following command at the end of my `~/.bashrc`:

```shell
export PATH=/home/spoto/Opt/moka:$PATH
```

#### Windows

You should download and untar the latest release
([https://github.com/Hotmoka/hotmoka/releases](https://github.com/Hotmoka/hotmoka/releases))
into the directory
where you want to install `moka`, by using a software tool such as
`7zip` or `Cygwin`. After that, you should be able to run the tool
from the command prompt:

```shell
$ cd directory-where-you-installed-moka
$ moka.bat help
```

In the following of this tutorial, remember to use `moka.bat` to invoke the
tool, where our examples use `moka` instead, which is the Linux name of
the invocation script.

You might want to add, to the command-path,
the directory where you installed `moka`,
so that it will be expanded correctly the next time you open
a command prompt window.
For that, add that directory to the `PATH` environment variable.

#### First Usage of `moka`

The `moka` tool should be
in the command-path of your shell now. You can check that it works, by invoking
`moka` as follows:

```shell
$ moka help
Usage: moka [COMMAND]
This is version @hotmoka_version of the Hotmoka command-line interface.
Commands:
  bind-key            Binds a key to a reference, so that it becomes an account
  burn                Burns coins from an account, if the node allows it
  call                Calls a method of an object or class
  create              Creates an object in the store of a node
  create-account      Creates a new account
  create-key          Creates a new key
  help                Displays help information about the specified command
  faucet              Sets the thresholds for the faucet of the gamete of a node
  import-account      Imports an account
  info                Prints information about a node
  init-memory         Initializes a new Hotmoka node in memory
  init-tendermint     Initializes a new Hotmoka node based on Tendermint
  install             Installs a jar in a node
  instrument          Instruments a jar
  mint                Mints new coins for an account, if the node allows it
  resume-tendermint   Resumes an existing Hotmoka node based on Tendermint
  send                Sends units of coin to a payable contract
  show-account        Shows an account
  start-tendermint    Starts a new Hotmoka node based on Tendermint  
  state               Prints the state of an object
  verify              Verifies a jar
```

As you can see above, the `moka help` command prints a description
of the available subcommands and exits.
You can have a detailed help of a specific subcommand
by specifying the subcommand after `help`.
For instance, to print the help of the
`faucet` subcommand, you can type:

```shell
$ moka help faucet
Usage: moka faucet [--interactive] [--max-red=<maxRed>]
                   [--password-of-gamete=<passwordOfGamete>] [--url=<url>] <max>
Sets the thresholds for the faucet of the gamete of a node
      <max>                the maximal amount of coins sent at each call to the
                             faucet of the node
                             Default: 0
      --interactive        run in interactive mode
      --max-red=<maxRed>   the maximal amount of red coins sent at each call to
                             the faucet of the node

      --password-of-gamete=<passwordOfGamete>
                           the password of the gamete account; if not
                             specified, it will be asked interactively
      --url=<url>          the url of the node (without the protocol)
                             Default: localhost:8080
```

### Mokito

The `moka` tool allows one to perform a large variety of operations
on a Hotmoka node. However, it is a technical tool, meant for developers.
Most users will only perform simple tasks with a Hotmoka node.
For them, it is simpler to use a mobile app, with a simpler user
interface. That app, called `Mokito`, is currently available for Android only.
You can download it from Google Play and install it in your device, from
[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.hotmoka.android.mokito](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.hotmoka.android.mokito). Developers interested in its Kotlin source code
can find it at
[https://github.com/Hotmoka/HotmokaAndroid](https://github.com/Hotmoka/HotmokaAndroid),
together with a small Android service for connecting to a remote Hotmoka node.

The first time you will use Mokito on your mobile device,
it will connect by default to our testnet Hotmoka node
and show the screen in Figure @fig:mokito_start. This can be changed
in the preferences section of the app, accessible through the menu in the
top left area of the app.

### Hotwallet

Hotwallet is a web client that can be installed as an extension to Chrome and Firefox.
It performs basic account handling and includes a JavaScript/TypeScript interface that can be queried
by web applications that need to access the user's accounts. This architecture has been inspired
by MetaMask for Ethereum. You can install Hotwallet inside the Firefox browser
as an add-on that can be downloaded from
[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hotwallet](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hotwallet).
Developers interested in its TypeScript source code can find it at
[https://github.com/Hotmoka/hotwallet-browser](https://github.com/Hotmoka/hotwallet-browser).
There is also a Hotweb3 JavaScript/TypeScript library for connecting web applications to the
Hotwallet browser extension and use its
accounts programmatically. Its source code can be found at
[https://github.com/Hotmoka/hotweb3](https://github.com/Hotmoka/hotweb3).

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="400" src="pics/hotwallet.png" alt="Figure @fig:hotwallet_start. The starting screen of the Hotwallet extension to the browser"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:hotwallet_start. The starting screen of the Hotwallet extension to the browser.</p>

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:hotwallet_start. The starting screen of the Hotwallet extension to the browser.](pics/hotwallet.png "Figure @fig:hotwallet_start. The starting screen of the Hotwallet extension to the browser."){ width=40% }

The first time you run Hotwallet, it will ask you to create a key or import an account
(see Figure @fig:hotwallet_start).
By default, Hotwallet will contact our test node at `panarea.hotmoka.io`,
but this can be changed with the menu item _Networks_.

Hotwallet is available for Google Chrome as well, but currently not yet through its web store.
Intead, it must be either compiled by hand
or installed as an unpacked extension. The latter solution is
the simplest. Namely, in order to install Hotwallet in Chrome as an unpacked extension,
do the following:

1. Download its latest release in zip format from [https://github.com/Hotmoka/hotwallet-browser/releases](https://github.com/Hotmoka/hotwallet-browser/releases)
2. Unzip the file (on Linux, run `unzip hotwallet_1.0.1.zip`)
3. Go to Chrome and select the menu item _More tools_ and subitem _Extensions_
4. Activate the _Developer mode_ with the switch in the top-right corner of the screen
5. Click on _Load unpacked_ (left-top corner of the screen) and select the directory
   where you unzipped the Hotwallet file
6. The extension should be installed now. If you want to add its small icon to the extensions
   bar of Chrome, for quick access, click on the icon of the extensions bar
   that looks like a puzzle piece and activate the pin mode for Hotwallet.

## Contacting a Hotmoka Test Node

The examples in this book must be run by a Hotmoka node,
typically part of a Hotmoka blockchain. We will show you in a later chapter how you
can install your own local
node or blockchain. However, for now, it is much simpler to experiment with a node
that is part of a public
test blockchain that we provide for experimentation.
Namely, we have installed a Hotmoka node at the address
`@server`.
You can verify that you can contact that node by typing
the command `moka info` to print information
about the node at that address, as you can see below:

```shell
$ moka info --url @server
Info about the node:
  takamakaCode: @takamakaCode
  manifest: @manifest
    chainId: @chainid
    maxErrorLength: 300
    signature: ed25519
    ...
    gamete: @gamete
      balance: 99999999999999999999...
      maxFaucet: @maxFaucet
      ...
    gasStation: @gasStation
      gasPrice: 1
      ...
    validators: @validators
      totalSupply: 1000000000000000...
      ...
```
The details of this information are irrelevant for now, but something must be
clarified, to understand the following sections better.
Namely, the `moka info` information is telling us that the node
already contains some code and Java objects, as shown in Figure @fig:state1.

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="650" src="pics/state1.png" alt="Figure @fig:state1. The state of the test network nodes"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:state1. The state of the test network nodes.</p>

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:state1. The state of the test network nodes.](pics/state1.png "Figure @fig:state1. The state of the test network nodes."){ width=72% }

The `takamakaCode` reference is the pointer to a jar, installed in blockchain, that contains
the classes of the Takamaka language runtime. All programs that we will write in Takamaka
will depend on that jar, since they will use classes such
as `io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract` or annotations such as `io.takamaka.code.lang.View`.
The `manifest` reference, instead, points to a Java object that publishes
information about the node. Namely, it reports its chain identifier and
the signature algorithm that, by default, is used to sign the transactions for the node. The manifest points
to another object, called `gamete`, that is an account holding all coins
in blockchain, initially. Consequently, the gamete has a rich `balance`,
but also another interesting property, called `maxFaucet`, that states how much coins
it is willing to give up for free. In a real node, and differently from here,
that value should be zero. In this test network, instead, it is a non-zero value
that we will exploit for creating our first account, in
a minute. The `gasStation` refers to another Java object, that provides
information about the gas, such as its current `gasPrice`. Finally, there is
another Java object, called `validators`, that keeps information about the validator nodes of the network
and contains, for instance, the total supply of the cryptocurrency (how much cryptocurrency has
been minted up to now).

As we said in the previous section, Java objects in the Hotmoka node are identified by their
_storage reference_, such as `@gasStation`.
You can think at a storage reference as a machine-independent pointer inside the
memory, or state, of the node.

We have used the `moka` tool to see the manifest of a node. You can also use the
Mokito app for that. Namely, tap on the app menu icon on the top-left corner of the screen
and select _Manifest_ from the menu that will appear (see Figure @fig:mokito_menu).

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="300" src="pics/mokito_menu.png" alt="Figure @fig:mokito_menu. The menu of the Mokito app"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:mokito_menu. The menu of the Mokito app.</p>

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:mokito_menu. The menu of the Mokito app.](pics/mokito_menu.png "Figure @fig:mokito_menu. The menu of the Mokito app."){ width=30% }

After tapping on _Manifest_, a new screen will appear, containing the same information
that we found with `moka info` (see Figure @fig:mokito_manifest).

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="300" src="pics/mokito_manifest.png" alt="Figure @fig:mokito_manifest. The manifest of the Hotmoka node, shown in the Mokito app"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:mokito_manifest. The manifest of the Hotmoka node, shown in the Mokito app.</p>

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:mokito_manifest. The manifest of the Hotmoka node, shown in the Mokito app.](pics/mokito_manifest.png "Figure @fig:mokito_manifest. The manifest of the Hotmoka node, shown in the Mokito app."){ width=30% }

## Creation of a First Account

We need an account in the test network, that we will use later to pay for
installing code in blockchain and for running transactions. An account in Hotmoka
is something completely different from an account in other blockchains.
For instance, in Bitcoin and Ethereum accounts do not really exist, in the sense
that they are just an address derived from a private key, that can be used to control
information in blockchain. Their creation does not trigger any operation in blockchain,
it is performed completely off-chain. Instead, in Hotmoka, an account
is a Java object, more precisely an instance of the `io.takamaka.code.lang.ExternallyOwnedAccount`
class. That object must be allocated (_created_) in the memory of the Hotmoka node,
before it can be used. Moreover, such an object is not special in any way:
for instance, as for all other objects in the storage of the node, we must pay for its creation.
Currently, we have no accounts and consequently
no coins for paying the creation of a new object. In a real blockchain, we could
earn coins by working for the network, or as payment for some activity,
or by buying coins at an exchange.
In this test network, we will use the faucet of the gamete instead, that is willing
to send us up to @maxFaucet coins, for free. Namely, you can run the
following command in order to ask the faucet to create your first externally owned account,
funded with 50000000000 coins, initially. We will execute the following command-line
inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` directory, so that it will save the _entropy_ of your account
there, which will simplify your subsequent work:

```shell
$ moka create-account 50000000000 --payer faucet --url @server

Please specify the password of the new account: chocolate
Free account creation succeeds only if the gamete supports an open unsigned faucet.
Created account @account1.
Its entropy has been saved into the file
  "@account1.pem".
Please take note of the following passphrase of 36 words:

@36words_of_account1
```

A *storage reference*
`@account1` has been created.

> Note that this reference will be different in your machine, as well as the 36 words passphrase.
> Change these accordingly in the subsequent examples.

This storage reference is a machine-independent pointer to your account Java object, inside
the node. Moreover, a random sequence of bits, called _entropy_, has been generated
and saved into a `.pem` file. From that entropy, and the chosen password, it is possible
to derive private and (hence) public key of the account.
You should keep the `.pem` file secret since, together with the
password of the account (in our case, we chose `chocolate`),
it allows its owner to control your account and spend its coins.
Note that the password is not written anywhere: if you lose it, there is
no way to recover that password.

We will see in a moment what is the use of these 36 words passphrase generated by `moka`. For now,
let us check that our account really exists at its address,
by querying the node with the `moka state` command:

```shell
$ moka state @account1
  --url @server

This is the state of object
@account1
@@server

class io.takamaka.code.lang.ExternallyOwnedAccount
  (from jar installed at
   @takamakaCode)

  nonce:java.math.BigInteger = 0
  publicKey:java.lang.String = "@publickeyaccount1"
  balance:java.math.BigInteger =
    50000000000 (inherited from io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract)
  balanceRed:java.math.BigInteger =
    0 (inherited from io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract)
```

Note that the balance and the public key of the account are
fields of the account object. Moreover, note that Hotmoka knows
which is the class of the object at that address
(it is a `io.takamaka.code.lang.ExternallyOwnedAccount`)
and where that class is defined (inside the jar
at address `@takamakaCode`,
that is, `takamakaCode`).

> This is completely different from what happens, for instance,
> in Ethereum, where externally owned accounts and contract references and untyped at run time,
> so that it is not possible to reconstruct their class in a reliable way.
> Moreover, note that we have been able to create an object in blockchain

> already installed, at `takamakaCode`, and we do not
> need to repeat it every time we instantiate an object. Instead, the new object
> will refer to the jar that contains its bytecode.

In the following, you can use the `moka state` command on any object,
not just on your own account, whenever you want to inspect its state
(that includes the state inherited from its superclasses).

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="850" src="pics/state2.png" alt="Figure @fig:state2. The state of the test network nodes after the creation of our new account"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:state2. The state of the test network nodes after the creation of our new account.</p>

Figure @fig:state2 shows the state of the network nodes after the creation of our new account.
Since out test node is part of a blockchain, it is not only its state that has been modified,
but also that of all nodes that are part of the blockchain.

Whenever your account will run out of coins, you can recharge it with the
`moka send` command, using, again, the faucet as source of coins. Namely,
if you want to recharge your account with 200000 extra coins, you can type:

```shell
$ moka send 200000
    @account1
    --payer faucet --url @server
```
You can then use the `moka state` command to verify that the balance of
your account has been actually increased with 200000 extra coins.

The creation of a new account from the faucet is possible from the Mokito app as well.
Namely, use the menu of the app to tap on the _Accounts_ item to see the
list of available accounts (Figure @fig:mokito_start). From there, tap on the
menu icon on the right of the _Faucet_ account and select _Create a new account_
(see Figure @fig:mokito_new_account).

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="300" src="pics/mokito_new_account.png" alt="Figure @fig:mokito_new_account. The menu for creating a new account with Mokito"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:mokito_new_account. The menu for creating a new account with Mokito.</p>

A form will appear, where you can specify the
name for the account, its password and the initial balance (that will be paid by the faucet).
For instance, you can fill it as in Figure @fig:mokito_elvis_new_account.

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="300" src="pics/mokito_elvis_new_account.png" alt="Figure @fig:mokito_elvis_new_account. The form specifying a new account Elvis"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:mokito_elvis_new_account. The form specifying a new account Elvis.</p>

After tapping on the `Create new account` button, the new account will be created and
its information will be shown, as in Figure @fig:mokito_show_elvis. Again, note in this screen the storage reference of the new account
and the presence of a 36 words passphrase.

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="300" src="pics/mokito_show_elvis.png" alt="Figure @fig:mokito_show_elvis. The new account Elvis"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:mokito_show_elvis. The new account Elvis.</p>

If you go back to the accounts screen (by using the top-left menu of Mokito), you will see that Elvis
has been added to your accounts (see Figure @fig:mokito_added_elvis).

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="300" src="pics/mokito_added_elvis.png" alt="Figure @fig:mokito_added_elvis. The new account Elvis has been imported"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:mokito_added_elvis. The new account Elvis has been imported.</p>

## Importing Accounts

We have created `@account1` with `moka` and
`@account_mokito` with Mokito. We might want to _import_ the former in Mokito and the latter
in `moka`, and we want to import both inside Hotwallet,
so that we can operate on both accounts with all three tools. In order to import
`@account_mokito` in `moka`, we can use the `moka import-account` command and insert its 36 words
passphrase:


```shell
$ moka import-account

Insert the 36 words of the passphrase of the account to import:
@36words_of_account_mokito
The account @account_mokito 
  has been imported.
Its entropy has been saved into the file
  "@account_mokito.pem".
```

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="300" src="pics/mokito_accounts_menu.png" alt="Figure @fig:mokito_accounts_menu. The menu of the accounts screen"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:mokito_accounts_menu. The menu of the accounts screen.</p>

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="300" src="pics/mokito_added_the_boss.png" alt="Figure @fig:mokito_added_the_boss. The new account The Boss has been imported"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:mokito_added_the_boss. The new account The Boss has been imported.</p>

From this moment, it is possible to control that account with `moka` (if we remember
its password, that is, `chocolate`).

Vice versa, with Mokito, go to the accounts page, show its
top-right menu and select _Import account_ (see Figure @fig:mokito_accounts_menu).
In the screen that will appear, insert the name that you want to give to the account,
its password and its 36 words passphrase
(Figure @fig:mokito_insert_passphrase).
Tap on the _Import Account_ button. The new account will show in the list of available accounts
(Figure @fig:mokito_added_the_boss). From this moment, it will be possible to control the account
from Mokito.

In Hotwallet, click on the top-right menu ans select _Import account_. From there, you can insert
the password and the 36 words passphrase of each account and see them imported in Hotwallet. You can see the
list of all available accounts with the same menu, if you click on _Account list_. You can click on
each account and switch from one to the other. Every time you change the account,
Hotwallet requires to insert its password.

As you have seen, the 36 words and the password of an account are enough for moving accounts around
different clients. Note that clients do not _contain_ accounts but only the cryptographic information
needed to access the accounts. If a client is uninstalled, the accounts that it used still exist in the remote
Hotmoka node and can still be re-imported and used
in some other client, if we have written down their 36 words and still remember their passwords.

## Anonymous Payments

The fact that accounts in Hotmoka are not just identified by their public key, but also by their
storage reference inside the state of a node, makes it a bit more difficult, but not impossible,
to execute anonymous transactions. We do not advocate the use of anonymity here, but it is true
that, sometimes, one wants to remain anonymous and still receive a payment.

> Anonymicity is often used for illegal actions such as ransomware and blackmailing.
> We are against such actions. This section simply shows that anonymity can be achieved
> in Hotmoka as well, although it is a bit harder than with other blockchains.

Suppose for instance that somebody, whom we call Anonymous, wants to receive from us a payment
of 10,000 coins, but still wants to remain unknown. He can receive the payment in many ways:

1. He could send us an anonymous email asking us to pay to a specific account, already existing
   in the state of the node. But this is not anonymous, since, in Hotmoka, an account is an object
   and there must have been a transaction that created that object, whose payer is likely to be
   Anonymous or somebody in his clique. That is, the identity of Anonymous can
   be inferred from the creator of the account. Therefore, Anonymous discards this possibility.
2. He could send us an anonymous email asking
   us to create a new account with a given public key, whose associate
   private key he controls, and to charge it with 10,000 coins. After that, we are expected
   to send him an email where we notify him the storage reference where
   `moka create-account` has allocated the account. But this means that we must know his
   email address, which is definitely against the idea of anonymity. Therefore,
   Anonymous discards this possibility as well.
3. He could send us an anonymous email asking us _to pay to a given public key_, whose
   associated private key he controls.
   After we pay to that key, he autonomously and anonymously recovers the storage reference of the
   resulting account, without any interaction with us. This is definitely anonymous and that is
   the technique that Anonymous will choose.

Let us show how the third possibility works. Anonymous starts by creating a new private/public key,
exactly as one would do in Ethereum and other blockchains. He runs the following command:
```shell
$ moka create-key

Please specify the password of the new key: kiwis
A new key @new_key has been created.
Its entropy has been saved into the file
  "./@new_key.pem".
```
Note that there is no `--url` part in the `moka create-key` command, since this operation
runs completely off-line: no object gets created in the state of any Hotmoka node for now.
Anonymous pastes the new key into an anonymous email message to us:

```
Please pay 10000 coins to the key @new_key.
```

Once we receive this email, we use (for instance) our previous account to send 10000 coins to that key:

```shell
$ moka send 10000 @new_key
    --anonymous
    --payer @account1
    --url @server

Please specify the password of the payer account: chocolate
Do you really want to spend up to 700000 gas units to send the coins [Y/N] Y
Total gas consumed: 63544
  for CPU: 985
  for RAM: 2141
  for storage: 60418
  for penalty: 0
The owner of the key can now see the new account associated to the key.
```

And that's all! No other interaction is needed with Anonymous. He will check
from time to time to see if we have paid, by running the command `moka bind-key`
until it succeeds:

```shell
$ moka bind-key @new_key
    --url @server

Cannot bind: nobody has paid anonymously to the key
  @new_key up to now.

$ moka bind-key @new_key
    --url @server

Cannot bind: nobody has paid anonymously to the key
  @new_key up to now.

$ moka bind-key @new_key
    --url @server

A new account @account_anonymous
  has been created.
Its entropy has been saved into the file
  "./@account_anonymous.pem".
```
Once `moka bind-key` succeeds, Anonymous can enjoy his brand new account, that he
can control with the `kiwis` password.

So how does that work? The answer is that the `--anonymous` option to `moka send`
creates the account `@account_anonymous` with the public key of
Anonymous inside it, so that Anonymous will be able to control that account.
But there is more: the `moka send` command will also associate that account to the
key `@new_key` inside a hash map contained in the manifest of the node,
called _accounts ledger_. The `moka bind-key` command will simply query that
hash map, to see if somebody has already bound an account to `@new_key`.

> If, inside the accounts ledger, there is an account _C_ already associated to the key `@new_key`,
> then the `moka send` command will not create a new account but will increase the
> balance of _C_ and the `moka bind-key` command will consequently yield _C_.
> This is a security measure in order
> to avoid payment disruptions due to the association of dummy accounts to some keys
> or to repeated payments to the same key.
> In any case, the public key of _C_ can only be `@new_key`, since the accounts ledger
> enforces that constraint when it gets populated with accounts:
> if somebody associates a key _K_ to an account _C_, then the public key
> contained inside _C_ must be _K_.

Anonymous payments are possible with Mokito and Hotwallet as well. Both clients
allow one to create a key and pay to a key.

Should one use anonymous payments, always? The answer is no, since
anonymity incurs into an extra gas cost: that of modifying the accounts ledger.
If there is no explicit need for anonymity, it is cheaper to receive payments
as described in points 1 and 2 considered above, probably without the need of anonymous emails.

## Installation of the Source Code

You will *not* need to download and install to source code of Hotmoka in this
book. Nevertheless, an important aspect of blockchain technology is that
trust is based also on the public availability of its code.
Moreover, you will need to download the source code if you want to understand
its inner working, or contribute to the development of the project or
fork the project.

Hence, we show below how to download the source code
of Hotmoka and of the runtime of the Takamaka language.
You will need Java JDK version at least 11.

Clone the project with:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Hotmoka/hotmoka.git
```

then `cd` to the `hotmoka` directory and
compile, package, test and install the Hotmoka jars:

```shell
$ mvn clean install

All tests should pass and all projects should be successfully installed:

If you want to edit the source code inside an IDE, you can import it in Eclipse, NetBeans or IntelliJ.
In Eclipse, use the File &rarr; Import &rarr; Existing Maven Projects menu item and import
the parent Maven project contained in the `hotmoka` directory that you cloned from
GitHub. This should create, inside Eclipse, also its submodule projects.
You should see, inside Eclipse's project explorer, something like Figure @fig:projects.
You will then be able to compile, package, test and install the Hotmoka jars inside
Eclipse itself, by right-clicking on the `parent` project and selecting
`Run As` and then the `Mavel install` target. You will also be able to run the tests inside
the Eclipse JUnit runner, by right-clicking on the `io-hotmoka-tests` subproject
and selecting `Run As` and then the `JUnit Test` target.

The Maven configuration of the project specifies that all modules and their dependencies
get copied into the `modules` directory as result of compilation with Maven (also
from inside Eclipse),
classified as automatic, explicit and unnamed
modules (as from Java 9 onwards). You can see this by typing:

```shell
$ ls -R modules

modules/:
automatic  explicit  unnamed

modules/automatic:
bcel-6.2.jar
spring-beans-5.2.7.RELEASE.jar
spring-core-5.2.7.RELEASE.jar
...
io-hotmoka-tendermint-abci-@hotmoka_version.jar
io-hotmoka-toml-@hotmoka_version.jar
io-hotmoka-ws-client-@hotmoka_version.jar
io-hotmoka-xodus-@hotmoka_version.jar
...

modules/explicit:
bcprov-jdk15on-1.70.jar
io-hotmoka-local-@hotmoka_version.jar
io-hotmoka-verification-@hotmoka_version.jar
gson-2.8.6.jar
io-hotmoka-memory-@hotmoka_version.jar
io-hotmoka-service-@hotmoka_version.jar
io-hotmoka-crypto-@hotmoka_version.jar
io-hotmoka-patricia-@hotmoka_version.jar
io-hotmoka-tendermint-@hotmoka_version.jar
...
io-takamaka-code-@hotmoka_version.jar
it-univr-bcel-1.1.0.jar
picocli-4.6.1.jar

modules/unnamed:
animal-sniffer-annotations-1.19.jar
jakarta.el-3.0.3.jar
...
```

It is not possible to discuss here the difference between
these kinds of modules (see [[MakB17]](#references) for that).
Just remember that explicit and
automatic modules must be put in the module path, while
unnamed modules must stay in the class path. Eclipse should
do this automatically for us, as does the `moka` script that we have
installed previously.

# A First Takamaka Program

Takamaka is the language that can be used to write
smart contracts for Hotmoka nodes. Hotmoka
nodes and Takamaka code have exactly the same
relation as Ethereum nodes and Solidity code.

Let us start from a simple example of Takamaka code. Since we are
writing Java code, there is nothing special to learn or install
before starting writing programs in Takamaka. Just use your
preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for Java. Or even
do everything from command-line, if you prefer. Our examples below will be
shown for the Eclipse IDE, using Java 11 or later, but you can perfectly well
use the IntelliJ IDE instead.

Our goal will be to create a Java class that we will instantiate
and use in blockchain. Namely, we will learn how to create an object
of that class, that will be persisted in blockchain, and how we can later
call the `toString()` method on that instance in blockchain.

## Creation of the Eclipse Project

__[See the `family` project inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

Let us create a Maven project `family` inside Eclipse,
in the `hotmoka_tutorial` directory.
For that, in the Eclipse's Maven wizard
(New &rarr; Maven project) specify the options
*Create a simple project (skip archetype selection)*
and deselect the *Use default Workspace directory* option,
specifying a subdirectory `family` of the `hotmaok_tutorial` directory as *Location* instead.
Hence, *Location* should be something that ends with `.../tutorial/family`.
Do not add the project to any working set. Use `io.hotmoka`
as Group Id and `family` as Artifact Id.

> The Group Id can be changed as you prefer, but we will stick
> to `io.hotmoka` to show the exact files that you will see in Eclipse.

By clicking *Finish* in the Eclipse's Maven wizard, you should see
a new Maven project in the Eclipse's explorer.
Currently, Eclipse creates a default `pom.xml` file that uses Java 5
and has no dependencies. Replace hence
the content of the `pom.xml` file of the `family` project with the code that follows:

```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
                        http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>io.hotmoka</groupId>
  <artifactId>family</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1</version>

  <properties>
    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
    <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target>
    <failOnMissingWebXml>false</failOnMissingWebXml>
  </properties>

  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.hotmoka</groupId>
      <artifactId>io-takamaka-code</artifactId>
      <version>@hotmoka_version</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.8.1</version>
        <configuration>
          <release>11</release>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>

</project>
```

that specifies to use Java 11 and provides the dependency
to `io-takamaka-code`, that is, the run-time classes of the Takamaka smart contracts.

> We are using `@hotmoka_version` here, as version of the Hotmoka and Takamaka runtime
> projects. Replace that, if needed, with the latest version of such projects.

Since the `pom.xml` file has changed, Eclipse will normally show an error
in the `family` project. To solve it,
you need to update the Maven dependencies of the project:
right-click on the `family` project &rarr; Maven &rarr; Update Project...

As you can see, we are importing the dependency `io-takamaka-code`,
that contains the Takamaka runtime. This will be downloaded from Maven
and everything should compile without errors.
The result in Eclipse should look similar to what is
shown in Figure @fig:family.

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="280" src="pics/family.png" alt="Figure @fig:family. The family Eclipse project"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:family. The family Eclipse project.</p>

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:family. The `family` Eclipse project.](pics/family.png "Figure @fig:family. The family Eclipse project."){ width=40% }

Create a `module-info.java` file inside `src/main/java`
(right-click on the `family` project &rarr; Configure &rarr; Create module-info.java &rarr; Create),
to state that this project depends on the module containing the runtime of Takamaka:

```java
module family {
  requires io.takamaka.code;
}
```

Create a package `io.takamaka.family` inside `src/main/java`. Inside that package,
create a Java source `Person.java`, by copying and pasting the following code:

```java
package io.takamaka.family;

public class Person {
  private final String name;
  private final int day;
  private final int month;
  private final int year;
  public final Person parent1;
  public final Person parent2;

  public Person(String name, int day, int month, int year,
                Person parent1, Person parent2) {

    this.name = name;
    this.day = day;
    this.month = month;
    this.year = year;
    this.parent1 = parent1;
    this.parent2 = parent2;
  }

  public Person(String name, int day, int month, int year) {
    this(name, day, month, year, null, null);
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return name + " (" + day + "/" + month + "/" + year + ")";
  }
}
```

This is a plain old Java class and should not need any comment.

Package the project into a jar, by running the following shell command inside
the directory of the project (that is, the subdirectory `family` of the
directory `hotmoka_tutorial`):

```shell
$ mvn package
```

A `family-0.0.1.jar` file should appear inside the `target` directory.
Only the compiled
class files will be relevant: Hotmoka nodes will ignore source files, manifest
and any resources in the jar; the same compiled
`module-info.class` is irrelevant for them.
All such files can be removed from the jar, to reduce the gas cost of their
installation in the store of a node, but we do not care about this optimization here.
The result should look as in Figure @fig:family_jar:

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="300" src="pics/family_jar.png" alt="Figure @fig:family_jar. The family Eclipse project, exported in jar"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:family_jar. The family Eclipse project, exported in jar.</p>

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:family_jar. The `family` Eclipse project, exported in jar.](pics/family_jar.png "Figure @fig:family_jar. The family Eclipse project, exported in jar."){ width=40% }

## Installation of the Jar in a Hotmoka Node

__[See the `runs` project inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

We have generated the jar containing our code and we want to send it now to a Hotmoka node,
where it will be installed. This means that it will become available to programmers
who want to use its classes, directly or as dependencies of their programs.
In order to install a jar in the Hotmoka node that we have used in the previous chapter,
we can use the `moka` command-line tool, specifying which account will pay for the
installation of the jar. The cost of the installation depends on the size of the
jar and on the number of its dependencies. The `moka` tool uses a heuristics to
foresee the cost of installation. Move inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` directory, if you are not
there already, so that
`moka` will find your saved entropy there, and run the `moka install` command:

```shell
$ cd hotmoka_tutorial
$ moka install family/target/family-0.0.1.jar
    --payer @account1
    --url @server

Please specify the password of the payer account: chocolate
Do you really want to spend up to 494900 gas units to install the jar [Y/N] Y
family/target/family-0.0.1.jar has been installed
at @family_address
Total gas consumed: 219355
  for CPU: 261
  for RAM: 1299
  for storage: 217795
  for penalty: 0
```

As you can see above, the jar has been installed at a reference, that can be used
later to refer to that jar. This has costed some gas, paid by our account.
You can verify that the balance of the account has been decreased, through the
`moka state` command.

The state of the the Hotmoka nodes of the testnet is now as in Figure @fig:state3.
As that figure shows, a dependency has been created, automatically, from `family-0.0.1.jar` to
`io-takamaka-code.jar`. This is because all Takamaka code will use the run-time classes of the Takamaka language,
hence the `moka install` command adds them, by default. Note that a dependency must already be installed in the node
before it can be used as dependency of other jars.

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="850" src="pics/state3.png" alt="Figure @fig:state3. The state of the test network nodes after the installation of our jar"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:state3. The state of the test network nodes after the installation of our jar.</p>

What we have done above is probably enough for most users, but sometimes you need
to perform the same operation in code, for instance in order to implement a software
application that connects to a Hotmoka node and runs some transactions.
Therefore, we describe below how you can write a Java program that installs the
same jar in the Hotmoka node, without using the `moka install` command.
A similar translation in code can be performed for all examples in this tutorial,
but we will report it only for a few of them.

Let us hence create another Eclipse Maven project
`runs`, inside `hotmoka_tutorial`,
exactly as we did in the previous section for the `family` project.
Specify Java 11 (or later) in its build configuration.
Use `io.hotmoka` as Group Id and `runs` as Artifact Id.
This is specified in the following `pom.xml`, that you should copy inside
the `runs` project, replacing that generated by Eclipse:

```xml

      <version>@hotmoka_version</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

</project>
```

This `pom.xml` specifies a few dependencies. We do not need all of them now,
but we will need them along the next sections, hence let us insert them all already.
These dependencies get automatically downloaded from the Maven repository.

Since we modified the file `pom.xml`, Eclipse should show an error
for the `runs` project. To fix it,
you need to update the Maven dependencies of the project:
right-click on the `runs` project &rarr; Maven &rarr; Update Project...

Leave directory `src/test/java` empty, by deleting its content, if not already empty.

The result should look as in Figure @fig:runs.

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="300" src="pics/runs.png" alt="Figure @fig:runs. The `runs` Eclipse project"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:runs. The `runs` Eclipse project.</p>

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:runs. The `runs` Eclipse project.](pics/runs.png "Figure @fig:runs. The `runs` Eclipse project."){ width=40% }

Create a `module-info.java` inside `src/main/java`, containing:

```java
module runs {
  requires io.hotmoka.beans;
  requires io.hotmoka.nodes;
  requires io.hotmoka.helpers;
  requires io.hotmoka.remote;
  requires io.hotmoka.crypto;
  requires io.hotmoka.memory;
  requires io.hotmoka.tendermint;
  requires io.hotmoka.service;
  requires io.hotmoka.constants;
}
```

Again, we do not need all these dependencies already, but we will need them later.

Create a package
`runs` inside `src/main/java` and add the following class `Family.java` inside it:

```java
package runs;

```
As you can see, this class creates an instance of a `RemoteNode`, that represents a Hotmoka
node installed in a remote host. By specifying the URL of the host, the `RemoteNode` object
exposes all methods of a Hotmoka node. It is an `AutoCloseable` object, hence it is placed inside
a try-with-resource statement that guarantees its release at the end of the `try` block.
By using that remote node, our code collects
some information about the node: the reference to the `io-takamaka-code` jar already
installed inside it (`takamakaCode`) and the signature algorithm used by the node (`signature`),
that it uses to construct a `signer` object that signs with the private key of our account,
loaded from disk.

The `loadKeys` method accesses the `.pem` file that we have previously created
with `moka`. It does it by looking in the parent directory `..`, that is where that file should be.

Like every Hotmoka node, the observable state of the remote node can only evolve through
*transactions*, that modify its state in an atomic way.
Namely, the code above performs three transactions:

1. A call to the `nonce()` method of our account: this is a progressive counter of the number
   of transactions already performed with our account. It starts from zero, but our account has been
   already used for other transactions (through the `moka` tool). Hence we better ask the
   node about it. As we will see later, this transaction calls a `@View` method. All calls
   to `@View` methods have the nice feature of being *for free*: nobody will pay for them.
   Because of that, we do not need to sign this transaction, or to provide a correct nonce,
   or specify a gas price. The limitation of such calls is that their transactions are not
   checked by consensus, hence we have to trust the node we ask. Moreover, they can only
   read, never write the data in the store of the node.
2. A call to the `getChainId()` method of the manifest of the node. Also this is a call to
   a `@View` method, hence it costs nothing. The code invokes the method
   `runInstanceMethodCallTransaction()` of the node, with the `account` object as receiver of the call.
3. The addition of our jar in the node. This time the transaction has a cost and our
   account is specified as payer. The signer of our account signs the transaction.
   Nonce of our account and chain identifier of the network are relevant, as well as the
   gas price, that must at least match that of the network.
   The code uses the `addJarStoreTransaction()` method, that executes a new transaction
   on the node, whose goal is to install a jar inside it. The jar is provided as a sequence of bytes
   (`Files.readAllBytes("../family/target/family-0.0.1.jar")`, assuming that the
   `family` project is a sibling of the project `runs`).
   The request passed to `addJarStoreTransaction()` specifies that the transaction can cost up
   to 300,000 units of gas, that can be bought at a price returned by the `gasHelper` object. The request
   specifies that its class path is `node.getTakamakaCode()`: this is the reference to the
   `io-takamaka-code` jar already installed in the node.
   Finally, the request specifies that `family-0.0.1.jar` has only
   a single dependency: `io-takamaka-code`. This means that when, later, we will refer to
   `family-0.0.1.jar` in a class path, this class path will indirectly include its dependency
   `io-takamaka-code` as well (see Figure @fig:state3).

You can run the program by selecting class `Family` in Eclipse and then
the run menu option or the run green arrow of Eclipse.

You should see the following on the screen:
```
family-0.0.1.jar installed at:
@code_family_address
```
The exact address will change. In any case, note that this reference to the jar is functionally equivalent to that
obtained before with the `moka install` command: they point to the same jar.

## Creation of an Object of our Program

__[See projects `runs` and `family_storage` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

The jar of our program is in the store of the node now: the `moka install` command
has installed it at
`@family_address`
and our code at `@code_family_address`.
We can use either of them, interchangeably, as class path for the execution of a transaction that
tries to run the constructor of `Person` and add a brand
new `Person` object into the store of the node. We can perform this through the `moka` tool:

```shell
$ cd hotmoka_tutorial # if you are not already there
$ moka create
    io.takamaka.family.Person
    "Albert Einstein" 14 4 1879 null null
    --payer @account1
    --classpath @family_address
    --url @server

Please specify the password of the payer account: chocolate
Do you really want to spend up to 500000 gas units to call
public Person(String,int,int,int,Person,Person) ? [Y/N] Y
Total gas consumed: 500000
  for CPU: 290
  for RAM: 1225
  for storage: 11310
  for penalty: 487175
io.hotmoka.beans.TransactionException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:
an object of class io.takamaka.family.Person cannot be kept in store
since it does not implement io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage
```

The `moka create` command requires to specify who pays for the object creation
(our account), then the fully-qualified name of the class that we want to instantiate
(`io.takamaka.family.Person`) followed by the actual arguments passed to its constructor.
The classpath refers to the jar that we have installed previously. The `moka create` command
asks for the password of the payer account and
checks if we really want to proceed (and pay). Then it ends up in failure
(`TransactionException`). Note that
all offered gas has been spent.
This is a sort of *penalty* for running a transaction that fails. The rationale is that this penalty should discourage
potential denial-of-service attacks, when a huge number of failing transactions are thrown at a
node. At least, that attack will cost a lot. Moreover, note that the transaction, although
failed, does exist. Indeed, the nonce of the caller has been increased, as you can check with `moka state`
on your account.

But we still have not understood why the transaction failed. The reason is in the exception
message: `an object of class io.takamaka.family.Person cannot be kept in store since it does not implement io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage`.
Takamaka requires
that all objects stored in a node extend the `io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage` class. That superclass
provides all the machinery needed in order to keep track of updates to such objects and persist them
in the store of the node, automatically.

> Do not get confused here. Takamaka does **not** require all objects to extend
> `io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage`. You can use objects that do not extend that superclass in your
> Takamaka code, both instances of your classes and instances of library classes
> from the `java.*` hierarchy, for instance. What Takamaka does require, instead, is that objects
> _that must be kept in the store of a node_ do extend `io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage`. This
> must be the case, for instance, for objects created by the constructor invoked through the
> `moka create` command.

Let us modify the `io.takamaka.family.Person.java` source code, inside the `family` project then:

```java
package io.takamaka.family;

import io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage;

public class Person extends Storage {
  ... unchanged code ...
}
```

> Extending `io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage` is all a programmer needs to do in order to let instances
> of a class be stored in the store of a node. There is no explicit method to call to keep track
> of updates to such objects and persist them in the store of the node:
> Hotmoka nodes will automatically deal with them.

> We can use the `io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage` class and we can run the resulting compiled code
> since that class is inside `io-takamaka-code`, that has been included in the
> class path as a dependency of `family-0.0.1.jar`.

Regenerate `family-0.0.1.jar`, by running `mvn package` again,
inside the `family` project, since class `Person` has changed.
Then run again the `moka create` command. This time, the execution should
complete without exception:

```shell
$ cd family
$ mvn clean package
$ cd ..
$ moka install family/target/family-0.0.1.jar
    --payer @account1
    --url @server
...
has been installed at
  @family2_address
...
$ moka create
    io.takamaka.family.Person
    "Albert Einstein" 14 4 1879 null null
    --payer @account1
    --classpath @family2_address
    --url @server

Please specify the password of the payer account: chocolate
Do you really want to spend up to 500000 gas units to call
public Person(String,int,int,int,Person,Person) ? [Y/N] Y

The new object has been allocated at
  @person_object

Total gas consumed: 41721
  for CPU: 291
  for RAM: 1235
  for storage: 40195
  for penalty: 0
```

The new object has been allocated at a storage reference that can be used
to refer to it, also in the future:
`@person_object`.
You can verify that it is actually there and that its fields are correctly initialized,
by using the `moka state` command:

```shell
$ cd hotmoka_tutorial
$ moka state @person_object
    --url @server

This is the state of object
@person_object
@@server

class io.takamaka.family.Person (from jar installed at
    @family2_address)

  day:int = 14
  month:int = 4
  name:java.lang.String = "Albert Einstein"
  parent1:io.takamaka.family.Person = null
  parent2:io.takamaka.family.Person = null
  year:int = 1879
```

We can perform the same object creation in code, instead of using the `moka create` command.
Namely, the following code builds on the previous example and installs a jar by adding
a further transaction that calls the constructor of `Person`:

}
```

The new transaction is due to the
`addConstructorCallTransaction()` method, that expands the node with a new transaction that calls
a constructor. We use our account as payer for the transaction, hence we sign
the request with its private key.
The class path includes `family-0.0.1.jar` and its dependency `io-takamaka-code`.
The signature of the constructor specifies that we are referring to the second
constructor of `Person`, the one that assumes `null` as parents. The actual parameters
are provided; they must be instances of the `io.hotmoka.beans.values.StorageValue` interface.
We provide 50,000 units of gas, which should be enough for a constructor that just initializes a few fields.
We are ready to pay `panarea(gasHelper.getSafeGasPrice())` units of coin for each unit of gas.
This price could have been
specified simply as `gasHelper.getSafeGasPrice()`
but we used the static method `io.hotmoka.beans.Coin.panarea()`
to generate a `BigInteger` corresponding to the smallest coin unit of Hotmoka nodes, a *panarea*.
Namely, the following units of coin exist:

| Value (in panas) | Exponent           | Name | Short Name |
| --------------------- |:-------------:| ----- | ----- |
| 1      | 1 | panarea | pana |
| 1,000  | 10<sup>3</sup> | alicudi | ali |
| 1,000,000 | 10<sup>6</sup> | filicudi | fili |
| 1,000,000,000 | 10<sup>9</sup> | stromboli | strom |
| 1,000,000,000,000 | 10<sup>12</sup> | vulcano | vul |
| 1,000,000,000,000,000 | 10<sup>15</sup> | salina | sali |
| 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 | 10<sup>18</sup> | lipari | lipa |
| 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 | 10<sup>21</sup> | moka | moka |

with corresponding static methods in `io.hotmoka.beans.Coin`.

Run `Family2` from Eclipse.
You should see the following on the console:
```
New object allocated at
@person2_object
```
The exact address will change at any run.

## Calling a Method on an Object in a Hotmoka Node

__[See projects `runs` and `family_exported` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

In the previous section, we have created an object of class `Person` in the store
of the node. Let us invoke the
`toString()` method on that object now. For that, we can use the `moka call` command,
specifying our `Person` object as *receiver*.

> In object-oriented languages, the _receiver_ of a call to a non-`static`
> method is the object over which the method is executed, that is accessible
> as `this` inside the code of the method. In our case, we want to invoke
> `albert.toString()`, where `albert` is the object that we have created
> previously, hence the receiver of the call.
> The receiver can be seen as an implicit actual argument passed to a
> (non-`static`) method.

```shell
$ moka call
    @person_object
    toString
    --payer @account1
    --url @server

Please specify the password of the payer account: chocolate
Do you really want to spend up to 500000 gas units to call
public java.lang.String toString() ? [Y/N] Y

Total gas consumed: 0
  for CPU: 0
  for RAM: 0
  for storage: 0
  for penalty: 0
io.hotmoka.beans.TransactionRejectedException:
cannot pass as argument a value of the non-exported type io.takamaka.family.Person
```

Command `moka call` requires to specify, as its first arguments,
the receiver of the call (the `Person` object created previously) and the name of the
method to call (`toString`), followed by the actual arguments of the call, if any.
We use the switch `--payer` to specify
the payer of the transaction (our account).

As you can see above, the result is deceiving.

This exception occurs when we try to pass the `Person` object
as receiver of `toString()` (the receiver is a particular case of an actual
argument). That object has been created in store, has escaped the node
and is available through its storage reference. However, it cannot be passed back
into the node as argument of a call since it is not _exported_. This is a security feature of
Hotmoka. Its reason is that the store of a node is public and can be read freely.
Everybody can see the objects created in the store of a Hotmoka node
and their storage references can be used to invoke their methods and modify their state.
This is true also for objects meant to be private state components of other objects and that
are not expected to be freely modifiable from outside the node. Because of this,
Hotmoka requires that classes, whose instances can be passed into the node as
arguments to methods or constructors,
must be annotated as `@Exported`. This means that the programmer acknowledges the
use of these instances from outside the node.

> Note that all objects can be passed, from _inside_ the blockchain, as arguments to methods
> of code in the node. The above limitation applies to objects passed from _outside_ the
> node only.

Let us modify the `Person` class again:

```java
...
import io.takamaka.code.lang.Exported;
...

@Exported
public class Person extends Storage {
  ...
}
```

Package the project `family` and try again to call the `toString` method:

```shell
$ cd family
$ mvn clean package
$ cd ..
$ moka install family/target/family-0.0.1.jar
    --payer @account1
    --url @server
...
has been installed at
  @family_exported_address
...
$ moka create
    io.takamaka.family.Person
    "Albert Einstein" 14 4 1879 null null
    --payer @account1
    --classpath @family_exported_address
    --url @server

...
The new object has been allocated at
  @person3_object
...
$ moka call
    @person3_object
    toString
    --payer @account1
    --url @server

...
Albert Einstein (14/4/1879)

Total gas consumed: 19707
  for CPU: 350
  for RAM: 1360
  for storage: 17997
  for penalty: 0
```

This time, the correct answer `Albert Einstein (14/4/1876)` appears on the screen.

> In Ethereum, the only objects that can be passed, from outside the blockchain,
> as argument to method calls into blockchain are contracts. Namely, in Solidity

We can do the same in code, instead of using the `moka call` command. Namely, we can expand
the `Family2` class seen before in order to run a further transaction, that calls `toString`.
Copy then the following `Family3` class inside the `runs` package of the `runs` project:

          gasHelper.getSafeGasPrice(), // gas price: at least the current gas price of the network
          takamakaCode, // class path for the execution of the transaction
          Files.readAllBytes(familyPath), // bytes of the jar to install
          takamakaCode)); // dependencies of the jar that is being installed

      nonce = nonce.add(ONE);

      // call the constructor of Person and store in albert the new object in blockchain
      StorageReference albert = node.addConstructorCallTransaction
        (new ConstructorCallTransactionRequest
          (signer, // an object that signs with the payer's private key
          account, // payer
          nonce, // payer's nonce: relevant since this is not a call to a @View method!

          new ConstructorSignature(PERSON, ClassType.STRING, INT, INT, INT),

          // actual arguments
          new StringValue("Albert Einstein"), new IntValue(14),
          new IntValue(4), new IntValue(1879)
      ));

      nonce = nonce.add(ONE);

      StorageValue s = node.addInstanceMethodCallTransaction
        (new InstanceMethodCallTransactionRequest
         (signer, // an object that signs with the payer's private key
         account, // payer
         nonce, // payer's nonce: relevant since this is not a call to a @View method!
         chainId, // chain identifier: relevant since this is not a call to a @View method!
         BigInteger.valueOf(50_000), // gas limit: enough for toString()
         panarea(gasHelper.getSafeGasPrice()), // gas price, in panareas
         family, // class path for the execution of the transaction

         // method to call: String Person.toString()
         new NonVoidMethodSignature(PERSON, "toString", ClassType.STRING),

         // receiver of the method to call
         albert
        ));

      // we increase our copy of the nonce, ready for further
      // transactions having the account as payer
      nonce = nonce.add(ONE);

      // print the result of the call
      System.out.println(s);
    }
  }

  private static KeyPair loadKeys(Node node, StorageReference account) throws Exception {
    return new Account(account, "..")
      .keys("chocolate", new SignatureHelper(node).signatureAlgorithmFor(account));
  }
}
```

The interesting part is the call to `addInstanceMethodCallTransaction()` at the end of the previous listing.
It requires to resolve method `Person.toString()` using `albert` as receiver
(the type `ClassType.STRING` is the return type of the method) and
to run the resolved method. It stores the result in
`s`, that subsequently prints on the standard output.

Run class `Family3` from Eclipse. You will obtain the same result as with `moka call`:

```shell
Albert Einstein (14/4/1879)
```

As we have shown, method `addInstanceMethodCallTransaction()` can be used to
invoke an instance method on an object in the store of the node. This requires some
clarification. First of all, note that the signature of the method to
call is resolved and the resolved method is then invoked. If
such resolved method is not found (for instance, if we tried to call `tostring` instead
of `toString`), then `addInstanceMethodCallTransaction()` would end up in
a failed transaction. Moreover, the usual resolution mechanism of Java methods applies.
If, for instance, we invoked
`new NonVoidMethodSignature(ClassType.OBJECT, "toString", ClassType.STRING)`
instead of
`new NonVoidMethodSignature(PERSON, "toString", ClassType.STRING)`,
then method `toString` would have be resolved from the run-time class of
`albert`, looking for the most specific implementation of `toString()`,
up to the `java.lang.Object` class, which would anyway end up in
running `Person.toString()`.

Method `addInstanceMethodCallTransaction()` can be used to invoke instance
methods with parameters. If a `toString(int)` method existed in `Person`,
then we could call it and pass 2019 as its argument, by writing:

```java
StorageValue s = node.addInstanceMethodCallTransaction
  (new InstanceMethodCallTransactionRequest(
    ...

    // method to call: String Person.toString(int)
    new NonVoidMethodSignature(PERSON, "toString", ClassType.STRING, INT),

    // receiver of the method to call
    albert,
  
    // actual argument(s)
    new IntValue(2019)
  ));
```

where we have added the formal parameter `INT`
(ie., `io.hotmoka.beans.types.BasicTypes.INT`)
and the actual argument `new IntValue(2019)`.

Method `addInstanceMethodCallTransaction()` cannot be used to call a static
method. For that, use `addStaticMethodCallTransaction()` instead, that accepts
a request similar to that for `addInstanceMethodCallTransaction()`, but without a receiver.

## Storage Types and Constraints on Storage Classes

We have seen how to invoke a constructor of a class to build an object in
the store of a node or to invoke a method on an object in the store of a node. Both constructors and
methods can receive arguments. Constructors yield a reference to a new
object, freshly allocated; methods might yield a returned value, if they are
not declared as `void`. This means that there is a bidirectional
exchange of data from outside the node to inside it, and back. But not any
kind of data can be exchanged:

1. The values that can be exchanged from inside the node to
   outside the node are called  _storage values_.
2. The values that can be exchanged from outside the node to
   inside the node are the same _storage values_ as above, with the extra constraint
   that objects must belong to an `@Exported` class.

The set of _storage values_ is the union of

1. primitive values of Java (characters, bytes, shorts, integers, longs, floats,
doubles and booleans);
2. reference values whose class extends `io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage` (that is, _storage objects_);
3. `null`;
4. elements of an `enum` without instance non-transient fields;
5. a few special reference values: `java.math.BigInteger`s and `java.lang.String`s.

Storage values cross the
node's boundary inside wrapper objects. For instance the integer 2019
is first wrapped into `new IntValue(2019)` and then passed
as a parameter to a method or constructor. In our previous example,
when we called `Person.toString()`, the result `s` was actually a wrapper
of a `java.lang.String` object. Boxing and unboxing into/from wrapper objects
is automatic: our class `Person` does not show that machinery.

What should be retained of the above discussion is that constructors and
methods of Takamaka classes, if we want them to be called from outside the
node, must receive storage values as parameters and must return storage
values (if they are not `void` methods). A method that expects a parameter of
type `java.util.HashSet`, for instance, can be defined and called
from Takamaka code, inside the node, but cannot be called from outside the node,
such as, for instance, from the `moka` tool or from our `Family` class. The same
occurs if the method returns a `java.util.HashSet`.

We conclude this section with a formal definition of storage objects.
We have already said that storage objects can be kept in the store of a node
and their class must extend
`io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage`. But there are extra constraints. Namely,
fields of a storage objects are part of the representation of such
objects and must, themselves, be kept in store. Hence, a storage object:

1. has a class that extends (directly or indirectly) `io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage`, and
2. is such that all its fields hold storage values (primitives, storage objects, `null`,
elements of `enum`s without instance non-transient fields, a `java.math.BigInteger` or a `java.lang.String`).

Note that the above conditions hold for the class `Person` defined above. Instead,
the following are examples of what is **not** allowed in a field of a storage object:

1. arrays
2. collections from `java.util.*`

We will see later how to overcome these limitations.

> Again, we stress that such limitations only apply to storage objects.
> Other objects, that needn't be kept in the store of a node but are useful for
> the implementation of Takamaka code, can be defined in a completely free way
> and used in code that runs in the node.

## Transactions Can Be Added, Posted and Run

We have executed transactions on a Hotmoka node with methods
`addJarStoreTransaction()`, `addConstructorCallTransaction()`
and `addInstanceMethodCallTransaction()`. These methods, whose name
starts with `add`,
are *synchronous*, meaning that they block until the transaction is
executed (or fails). If they are invoked on a node with a notion of
commit, such as a blockchain, they guarantee to block until
the transaction is actually committed.
In many cases, when we immediately need the result of a transaction
before continuing with the execution of the
subsequent statements,
these methods are the right choice. In many other cases, however,
it is unnecessary to wait until the transaction has completed
its execution and has been committed. In those cases, it can
be faster to execute a transaction through a method whose name
starts with `post`, such as
`postJarStoreTransaction()`, `postConstructorCallTransaction()`
or `postInstanceMethodCallTransaction()`. These methods are called
*asynchronous*, since they terminate
immediately, without waiting for the outcome of the transaction
they trigger. Hence they cannot return their outcome immediately
and return a *future*
instead, whose `get()` value, if and when invoked, will block
until the outcome of the transaction is finally available.

For instance, instead of the inefficient:

```java
StorageValue s = node.addInstanceMethodCallTransaction
  (new InstanceMethodCallTransactionRequest(
    signer,
    account,
    nonce,
    chainId,
    BigInteger.valueOf(50_000),
    panarea(gasHelper.getSafeGasPrice()),
    family,
    new NonVoidMethodSignature(PERSON, "toString", ClassType.STRING),
    albert
  ));

// code that does not use s
// .....
```

one can write the more efficient:

```java
CodeSupplier<StorageValue> future = node.postInstanceMethodCallTransaction
  (new InstanceMethodCallTransactionRequest(
    signer,
    account,
    nonce,
    chainId,
    BigInteger.valueOf(50_000),
    panarea(gasHelper.getSafeGasPrice()),
    family,
    new NonVoidMethodSignature(PERSON, "toString", ClassType.STRING),
    albert
  ));

// code that does not use s
// .....

// the following will be needed only if s is used later
StorageValue s = future.get();
```

There is a third way to execute a transaction. Namely, calls to methods
annotated as `@View` can be performed through the
`runInstanceMethodCallTransaction()` (for instance methods) and
`runStaticMethodCallTransaction()` (for static methods).
As we have hinted before, these executions are performed
locally, on the node they are addressed to, and do not add a transaction
that must be replicated in each node of the network, for consensus, and
that costs gas for storage.
These executions are free and do not require a correct nonce, signature,
or chain identifier, which is a great simplification.

# The Notion of Smart Contract

A contract is a legal agreement among two or more parties. A good contract
should be unambiguous, since otherwise its interpretation could be
questioned or misunderstood. A legal system normally enforces the
validity of a contract. In the context of software development, a *smart contract*
is a piece of software with deterministic behavior, whose semantics should be
clear and enforced by a consensus system. Blockchains provide the perfect
environment where smart contracts can be deployed and executed, since their
(typically) non-centralized nature reduces the risk that a single party
overthrows the rules of consensus, by providing for instance a non-standard
semantics for the code of the smart contract.

Contracts are allowed to hold and transfer money to other contracts. Hence,
traditionally, smart contracts are divided into those that hold money
but have no code (*externally owned accounts*), and those that,
instead, contain code (*smart contracts*).
The formers are typically controlled by an external agent (a wallet,
a human or a software application, on his behalf)
while the latters are typically controlled by their code.
Takamaka implements both alternatives as instances of the abstract library class
`io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract` (inside `io-takamaka-code`). That class extends
`io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage`, hence its instances can be kept in the store
of the node. Moreover, that class is annotated as `@Exported`, hence nodes can receive
references to contract instances from the outside world.
The Takamaka library defines subclasses of `io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract`, that
we will investigate later. Programmers can define their own subclasses as well.

This chapter presents a simple smart contract, whose goal is to
enforce a Ponzi investment scheme: each investor pays back the previous investor,
with at least a 10% reward; as long as new
investors keep coming, each investor gets at least a 10% reward; the last
investor, instead, will never see his/her investment back.
The contract has been inspired by a similar Ethereum contract, shown
at page 145 of [[IyerD08]](#references).

We will develop the contract in successive versions, in order to highlight
the meaning of different language features of Takamaka.

## A Simple Ponzi Scheme Contract

__[See project `ponzi_simple` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

Create a new Maven Java 11 (or later) project in Eclipse, named `ponzi`.
You can do this by duplicating the project `family` (make sure to store
the project inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` directory, as a sibling of `family` and
`runs`). Use the following `pom.xml`:

```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0

</project>
```

and the following `module-info.java`:

```java
module ponzi {
  requires io.takamaka.code;
}
```

Create package `io.takamaka.ponzi` inside `src/main/java` and add
the following `SimplePonzi.java` source inside that package:

```java
package io.takamaka.ponzi;

import static io.takamaka.code.lang.Takamaka.require;
import java.math.BigInteger;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract;

public class SimplePonzi extends Contract {
  private final BigInteger _10 = BigInteger.valueOf(10L);
  private final BigInteger _11 = BigInteger.valueOf(11L);
  private Contract currentInvestor;
  private BigInteger currentInvestment = BigInteger.ZERO;

  public void invest(Contract investor, BigInteger amount) {
    // new investments must be at least 10% greater than current
    BigInteger minimumInvestment = currentInvestment.multiply(_11).divide(_10);
    require(amount.compareTo(minimumInvestment) >= 0,
      () -> "you must invest at least " + minimumInvestment);

    // document new investor
    currentInvestor = investor;
    currentInvestment = amount;
  }
}
```

> This code is only the starting point of our discussion and is not functional yet.
> The real final version of this contract will appear at the end of this section.

Look at the code of `SimplePonzi.java` above. The contract has a single
method, named `invest`. This method lets a new `investor` invest
a given `amount` of coins. This amount must be at least 10% higher than
the current investment. The expression `amount.compareTo(minimumInvestment) >= 0`
is a comparison between two Java `BigInteger`s and should be read as the
more familiar `amount >= minimumInvestment`: the latter cannot be
written in this form, since Java does not allow comparison operators
to work on reference types.
The static method `io.takamaka.code.lang.Takamaka.require()` is used to require
some precondition to hold. The `require(condition, message)` call throws an
exception if `condition` does not hold, with the given `message`.
If the new investment is at least 10% higher than the current one, it will be
saved in the state of the contract, together with the new investor.

## The `@FromContract` and `@Payable` Annotations

__[See project `ponzi_annotations` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

The previous code of `SimplePonzi.java` is unsatisfactory, for at least two
reasons, that we will overcome in this section:

1. Any contract can call `invest()` and let _another_ `investor` contract invest
   in the game. This is against our intuition that each investor decides when
   and how much he (himself) decides to invest.
2. There is no money transfer. Anybody can call `invest()`, with an arbitrary
   `amount` of coins. The previous investor does not get the investment back
   when a new investor arrives since, well, he never really invested anything.

Let us rewrite `SimplePonzi.java` in the following way:

```java
package io.takamaka.ponzi;

import static io.takamaka.code.lang.Takamaka.require;

import java.math.BigInteger;

import io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.FromContract;

public class SimplePonzi extends Contract {
  private final BigInteger _10 = BigInteger.valueOf(10L);
  private final BigInteger _11 = BigInteger.valueOf(11L);
  private Contract currentInvestor;
  private BigInteger currentInvestment = BigInteger.ZERO;

  public @FromContract void invest(BigInteger amount) {
    // new investments must be at least 10% greater than current
    BigInteger minimumInvestment = currentInvestment.multiply(_11).divide(_10);
    require(amount.compareTo(minimumInvestment) >= 0,
      () -> "you must invest at least " + minimumInvestment);

    // document new investor
    currentInvestor = caller();
    currentInvestment = amount;
  }
}
```

The difference with the previous version of `SimplePonzi.java`
is that the `investor` argument of `invest()` has disappeared.
At its place, `invest()` has been annotated as `@FromContract`. This annotation
**restricts** the possible uses of method `invest()`. Namely, it can
only be called from a contract object *c* or from an external wallet,
with a paying contract *c*, that pays for a transaction that runs
`invest()`. It cannot, instead, be called from
the code of a class that is not a contract.
The instance of contract *c* is available, inside
`invest()`, as `caller()`. This is, indeed, saved, in the above code,
into `currentInvestor`.

The annotation `@FromContract` can be applied to both methods and constructors.
If a `@FromContract` method is redefined, the redefinitions must also be
annotated as `@FromContract`.

> Method `caller()` can only be used inside a `@FromContract` method or
> constructor and refers to the contract that called that method or constructor
> or to the contract that pays for a call, from a wallet, to the method or constructor.
> Hence, it will never yield `null`. If a `@FromContract` method or constructor
> calls another method *m*, then the `caller()` of the former is **not** available
> inside *m*, unless the call occurs, syntactically, on `this`, in which case
> the `caller()` is preserved. By _syntactically_, we mean through expressions such as
> `this.m(...)` or `super.m(...)`.

The use of `@FromContract` solves the first problem: if a contract invests in the game,
then it is the caller of `invest()`. However, there is still no money
transfer in this version of `SimplePonzi.java`. What we still miss is to require
the caller of `invest()` to actually pay for the `amount` units of coin.
Since `@FromContract` guarantees that the caller of `invest()` is a contract and since
contracts hold money, this means that the caller contract of `invest()`
can be charged `amount` coins at the moment of calling `invest()`.
This can be achieved with the `@Payable` annotation, that we apply to `invest()`:

```java
package io.takamaka.ponzi;

import static io.takamaka.code.lang.Takamaka.require;

import java.math.BigInteger;

import io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.FromContract;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.Payable;

public class SimplePonzi extends Contract {
  private final BigInteger _10 = BigInteger.valueOf(10L);
  private final BigInteger _11 = BigInteger.valueOf(11L);
  private Contract currentInvestor;
  private BigInteger currentInvestment = BigInteger.ZERO;

  public @Payable @FromContract void invest(BigInteger amount) {
    // new investments must be at least 10% greater than current
    BigInteger minimumInvestment = currentInvestment.multiply(_11).divide(_10);
    require(amount.compareTo(minimumInvestment) >= 0,
      () -> "you must invest at least " + minimumInvestment);

    // document new investor
    currentInvestor = caller();
    currentInvestment = amount;
  }
}
```

When a contract calls `invest()` now, that contract will be charged `amount` coins,
automatically. This means tha these coins will be automatically transferred to the
balance of the instance of `SimplePonzi` that receives the call.
If the balance of the calling contract is too low for that, the call
will be automatically rejected with an insufficient funds exception. The caller
must be able to pay for both `amount` and the gas needed to run `invest()`. Hence,
he must hold a bit more than `amount` coins at the moment of calling `invest()`.

## Payable Contracts

__[See project `ponzi_payable` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

The `SimplePonzi.java` class is not ready yet. Namely, the code
of that class specifies that investors have to pay
an always increasing amount of money to replace the current investor.
However, in the current version of the code,
the replaced investor never gets his previous investment back, plus the 10% award
(at least): money keeps flowing inside the `SimplePonzi` contract and remains
stuck there, forever. The code needs an apparently simple change: just add a single statement
before the update of the new current investor. That statement should send
`amount` units of coin back to `currentInvestor`, before it gets replaced:

```java
// document new investor
if (currentInvestor != null)
  currentInvestor.receive(amount);
currentInvestor = caller();
currentInvestment = amount;
```

In other words, a new investor calls `invest()` and pays `amount` coins to
the `SimplePonzi` contract (since `invest()` is `@Payable`); then
this `SimplePonzi` contract transfers the same `amount` of coins to pay back the
previous investor. Money flows through the `SimplePonzi` contract but
does not stay there for long.

The problem with this simple line of code is that it does not compile.
There is no `receive()` method in `io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract`:
a contract can receive money only through calls to its `@Payable`
constructors and methods. Since `currentInvestor` is, very generically,
an instance of `Contract`, that has no `@Payable` methods,
there is no method
that we can call here for sending money back to `currentInvestor`.
This limitation is a deliberate design choice of Takamaka.

So how do we send money back to `currentInvestor`? The solution is to
restrict the kind of contracts that can participate to the Ponzi scheme.
Namely, we limit the game to contracts that implement class
`io.takamaka.code.lang.PayableContract`, a subclass of `io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract`
that, yes, does have a payable `receive()` method. This is not really a restriction,
since the typical players of our Ponzi contract are externally
owned accounts, that are instances of `PayableContract`.

Let us hence apply the following small changes to our `SimplePonzi.java` class:

1. The type of `currentInvestment` must be restricted to `PayableContract`.
2. The `invest()` method must be callable by `PayableContract`s only.
3. The return value of `caller()` must be cast to `PayableContract`, which is
   safe because of point 2 above.

The result is the following:

```java
package io.takamaka.ponzi;

import static io.takamaka.code.lang.Takamaka.require;

import java.math.BigInteger;

import io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.FromContract;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.Payable;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.PayableContract;

public class SimplePonzi extends Contract {
  private final BigInteger _10 = BigInteger.valueOf(10L);
  private final BigInteger _11 = BigInteger.valueOf(11L);
  private PayableContract currentInvestor;
  private BigInteger currentInvestment = BigInteger.ZERO;

  public @Payable @FromContract(PayableContract.class) void invest(BigInteger amount) {
    // new investments must be at least 10% greater than current
    BigInteger minimumInvestment = currentInvestment.multiply(_11).divide(_10);
    require(amount.compareTo(minimumInvestment) >= 0,
      () -> "you must invest at least " + minimumInvestment);

    // document new investor
    if (currentInvestor != null)
      currentInvestor.receive(amount);

    currentInvestor = (PayableContract) caller();
    currentInvestment = amount;
  }
}
```

Note the use of `@FromContract(PayableContract.class)` in the code above:
a method or constructor
annotated as `@FromContract(C.class)` can only be called by a contract whose class
is `C` or a subclass of `C`. Otherwise, a run-time exception will occur.

## The `@View` Annotation

__[See project `ponzi_view` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

Our `SimplePonzi.java` code can still be improved. As it is now,
an investor must call `invest()` and be ready to pay a sufficiently
large `amount` of coins to pay back and replace the previous investor.
How much is *large* actually large enough? Well, it depends on the
current investment. But that information is kept inside the contract
and there is no easy way to access it from outside.
An investor can only try with something that looks large enough,
running a transaction that might end up in two scenarios,
both undesirable:

1. The amount invested was actually large enough, but larger than needed: the investor
   invested more than required in the Ponzi scheme, taking the risk that no one
   will ever invest more and pay him back.
2. The amount invested might not be enough: the `require()` function
   will throw an exception that makes the transaction running `invest()` fail.
   The investment will not be transferred to the `SimplePonzi` contract, but
   the investor will be penalized by charging him all the gas provided for
   the transaction. This is unfair since, after all, the investor had no
   way to know that the proposed investment was not large enough.

Hence, it would be nice and fair to provide investors with a way to access
the value in the `currentInvestment` field.
This is actually a piece of cake: just add
this method to `SimplePonzi.java`:

```java
public BigInteger getCurrentInvestment() {
  return currentInvestment;
}
```

This solution is perfectly fine but can be improved. Written this way,
an investor that wants to call `getCurrentInvestment()` must run a
Hotmoka transaction through the `addInstanceMethodCallTransaction()`
method of the node, creating a new transaction that ends up in
the store of the node. That transaction will cost gas, hence its side-effect will
be to reduce the balance of the calling investor. But the goal of the caller
was just to access information in the store of the node, not to modify the store through
side-effects. The balance reduction for the caller is, indeed, the *only*
side-effect of that call! In cases like this, Takamaka allows one to
specify that a method is expected to have no side-effects on the visible
state of the node, but for the change of the balance of the caller.
This is possible through the `@View` annotation. Import that
class in the Java source and edit the declaration of `getCurrentInvestment()`,
as follows:

```java
import io.takamaka.code.lang.View;
...
  public @View BigInteger getCurrentInvestment() {
    return currentInvestment;
  }
```

An investor can now call that method through another API method of the Hotmoka
nodes, called `runInstanceMethodCallTransaction()`, that does not expand the
store of the node, but yields the response of the transaction, including the
returned value of the call. If method
`getCurrentInvestment()` had side-effects beyond that on the balance of
the caller, then the execution will fail with a run-time exception.
Note that the execution of a `@View` method still requires gas,
but that gas is given back at the end of the call.
The advantage of `@View` is hence that of allowing the execution
of `getCurrentInvestment()` for free and without expanding the store of the node
with useless transactions, that do not modify its state. Moreover,
transactions run through `runInstanceMethodCallTransaction()` do not need
a correct nonce, chain identifier or signature,
hence any constant value can be used for them.
This simplifies the call. For the same reason, transactions run
through `runInstanceMethodCallTransaction()` do not count for the computation of
the nonce of the caller.

> The annotation `@View` is checked at run time if a transaction calls the
> `@View` method from outside the blockchain, directly. It is not checked if,
> instead, the method is called indirectly, from other Takamaka code.

## The Hierarchy of Contracts

Figure @fig:contract_hierarchy shows the hierarchy of Takamaka contract classes.
The topmost abstract class `io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract`
extends `io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage`, since contracts are meant to be
stored in a node (as are other classes that are not contracts,
such as our first `Person` example).
Programmers typically extend `Contract` to define their own contracts.
This is the case, for instance, of our `SimplePonzi` class.
Class `Storage` provides a `caller()` final protected method that can be called inside
`@FromContract` methods and constructors, to access the calling contract.
Class `Contract` provides a final `@View` method `balance()` that
can be used to access the private `balance` field of the contract.
Note that class `Contract` is annotated with the inherited annotation `@Exported`,
hence contracts, such as instances of `SimplePonzi`, can be receivers of calls
from outside the node and can be passed as arguments to calls from outside the node.
Instances of `Storage` are not normally `@Exported`, unless their class
is explicitly annotated as `@Exported`, as we did for `Person`.

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:contract_hierarchy. The hierarchy of contract classes.](pics/contracts.png "Figure @fig:contract_hierarchy. The hierarchy of contract classes."){ width=105% }

The abstract subclass `PayableContract` is meant for contracts that
can receive coins from other contracts, through their final
`receive()` methods. Its concrete subclass named `ExternallyOwnedAccount` is
a payable contract that can be used to pay for a transaction.
Such _accounts_ are typically controlled by humans, through a wallet, but can be
subclassed and instantiated freely in Takamaka code. Their constructors
allow one to build an externally owned account and fund it with an initial
amount of coins. As we have seen in sections
[Installation of the Jar in a Hotmoka Node](#installation-of-the-jar-in-a-hotmoka-node),
[Creation of an Object of our Program](#creation-of-an-object-of-our-program) and
[Calling a Method on an Object in a Hotmoka Node](#calling-a-method-on-an-object-in-a-hotmoka-node),
the methods of Hotmoka nodes that start a transaction require to specify a payer
for that transaction. Such a payer is required to be an instance of
`ExternallyOwnedAccount`, or an exception will be thrown. In our previous examples,
we have used, as payer, an account created by the `moka create-account` command,
that is an instance of `io.takamaka.code.lang.ExternallyOwnedAccount`.
`ExternallyOwnedAccount`s have a private field `nonce` that can be accessed through
the public `@View` method `nonce()`: it yields a `BigInteger`
that specifies the next nonce to use for the next transaction having that
account as caller. This nonce gets automatically increased after each such transaction.

Instances of `ExternallyOwnedAccount`s hold their public key in their
private `publicKey` field, as a Base64-encoded string,
that can be accessed through the `publicKey()` method.
That key is used to verify the signature of the transactions
having that account as caller. As we will see later, there is a default signature
algorithms for transactions and that is what `ExternallyOwnedAccount`s use.
However, it is possible to require a specific signature algorithm, that overrides the default
for the node. For that, it is enough to instantiate classes `ExternallyOwnedAccountSHA256DSA`,
`ExternallyOwnedAccountED25519`, `ExternallyOwnedAccountQTESLA1`
or `ExternallyOwnedAccountQTESLA3`. The latter two use a
quantum-resistant signature algorithm
(see [Signatures and Quantum-Resistance](#signatures-and-quantum-resistance)
for more details). This means that it is possible
to mix many signature algorithms for signing transactions inside the same Hotmoka node,
as we will show later.

## Red and Green Balances

__[See project `redgreen` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

The `Contract` class of Takamaka has a double balance. Namely, it has
a normal (_green_) balance and an extra, stable _red_ balance.
That is, contracts have the ability to keep an extra red balance,
that should be a stable coin, if the underlying blockchain supports
that feature.

For instance, the following contract allows payees to
register by calling the `addAsPayee()` method.
Moreover, the contract distributes green coins sent to
the `distributeGreen()` method and red coins sent to the
`distributeRed()` method, sending the rest to the owner of the
contract (in general, there is a rest because of arithmetic
approximation). Hence, the contract holds coins only temporarily.
The `@RedPayable` annotation states that the
`distributeRed()` method can receive red coins when called.
Class `StorageLinkedList` holds a list of contracts and will be discussed in the
next chapter.

```java
package io.takamaka.redgreen;

import java.math.BigInteger;

import io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.FromContract;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.Payable;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.PayableContract;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.RedPayable;
import io.takamaka.code.util.StorageLinkedList;
import io.takamaka.code.util.StorageList;

public class Distributor extends Contract {
  private final StorageList<PayableContract> payees = new StorageLinkedList<>();
  private final PayableContract owner;

  public @FromContract(PayableContract.class) Distributor() {
    owner = (PayableContract) caller();
  }

  public @FromContract(PayableContract.class) void addAsPayee() {
    payees.add((PayableContract) caller());
  }

  public @Payable @FromContract void distributeGreen(BigInteger amount) {
    int size = payees.size();
    if (size > 0) {
      BigInteger eachGets = amount.divide(BigInteger.valueOf(size));
      payees.forEach(payee -> payee.receive(eachGets));
      owner.receive(balance());
    }
  }

  public @RedPayable @FromContract void distributeRed(BigInteger amount) {
    int size = payees.size();
    if (size > 0) {
      BigInteger eachGets = amount.divide(BigInteger.valueOf(size));
      payees.forEach(payee -> payee.receiveRed(eachGets));
      owner.receiveRed(balanceRed());
    }
  }
}
```

# The Support Library

This chapter presents the support library of the Takamaka language,
that contains classes for simplifying the definition of smart contracts.

In [Storage Types and Constraints on Storage Classes](#storage-types-and-constraints-on-storage-classes),
we said that storage objects must obey to some constraints.
The strongest of them is that their fields of reference type, in turn, can only hold
storage objects. In particular, arrays are not allowed there. This can
be problematic, in particular for contracts that deal with a
dynamic, variable, potentially unbound number of other contracts.

Therefore, most classes of the support library deal
with such constraints, by providing fixed or variable-sized collections
that can be used in storage objects, since they are storage objects themselves.
Such utility classes implement lists, arrays and maps and are
consequently generally described as *collections*. They have the
property of being storage classes, hence their instances can be kept in
the store of a Hotmoka node, *as long as only storage objects are added as elements of
the collection*. As usual with collections, these utility classes
have generic type, to implement collections of arbitrary, but fixed
types. This is not problematic, since Java (and hence Takamaka) allows generic types.

## Storage Lists

Lists are an ordered sequence of elements. In a list, it is typically
possible to access the first element in constant time, while accesses
to the *n*th element require to scan the list from its head and
consequently have a cost proportional to *n*. Because of this,
lists are **not**, in general, random-access data structures, whose *n*th
element should be accessible in constant time. It is also possible
to add an element at the beginning of a list, in constant time.
The size of a list is not fixed: lists grow in size as more elements are added.

Java has many classes for implementing lists, all subclasses
of `java.util.List<E>`. They can be used in Takamaka, but not as
fields of a storage class. For that,
Takamaka provides an implementation of lists with the storage class
`io.takamaka.code.util.StorageLinkedList<E>`. Its instances are storage objects and
can consequently be held in fields of storage classes and
can be stored in a Hotmoka node, *as long as only
storage objects are added to the list*. Takamaka lists provide
constant-time access and addition to both ends of a list.
We refer to the JavaDoc of `StorageLinkedList<E>` for a full description of its methods.
They include methods for adding elements to either ends of the list, for accessing and
removing elements, for iterating on a list and for building a Java array
`E[]` holding the elements of a list.

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="450" src="pics/lists.png" alt="Figure @fig:lists_hierarchy. The hierarchy of storage lists"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:lists_hierarchy. The hierarchy of storage lists.</p>

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:lists_hierarchy. The hierarchy of storage lists.](pics/lists.png "Figure @fig:lists_hierarchy. The hierarchy of storage lists."){ width=50% }

Figure @fig:lists_hierarchy shows the hierarchy of the `StorageLinkedList<E>` class.
It implements the interface `StorageList<E>`, that defines the methods that modify a list.
That interface extends the interface `StorageListView<E>` that, instead, defines the methods
that read data from a list, but do not modify it. This distinction between the _read-only_
interface and the _modification_ interface is typical of all collection classes in the
Takamaka library, as we will see. For the moment, note that this distinction is useful
for defining methods `snapshot()` and `view()`. Both return a `StorageListView<E>` but there
is an important difference between them. Namely, `snapshot()` yields a _frozen_ view of the list,
that cannot and will never be modified, also if the original list gets subsequently updated. Instead,
`view()` yields a _view_ of a list, that is, a read-only list that changes whenever
the original list changes and exactly in the same way: if an element is added to the original
list, the same automatically occurs to the view.
In this sense, a view is just a read-only alias of the original list.
Both methods can be useful to export data, safely,
from a node to the outside world, since both methods
return an `@Exported` object without modification methods.
Method `snapshot()` runs in linear time (in the length of the list)
while method `view()` runs in constant time.

> It might seem that `view()` is just an upwards cast to the
> interface `StorageListView<E>`. This is wrong, since that method

> To appreciate the difference to a cast, assume to have a `StorageList<E> list` and to write
> `StorageListView<E> view = (StorageListView<E>) list`. This upwards cast will always succeed.

Next section shows an example of use for `StorageLinkedList`.

### A Gradual Ponzi Contract

__[See project `ponzi_gradual` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

Consider our previous Ponzi contract again. It is somehow irrealistic, since
an investor gets its investment back in full. In a more realistic scenario,
the investor will receive the investment back gradually, as soon as new
investors arrive. This is more complex to program, since
the Ponzi contract must take note of all investors that invested up to now,
not just of the current one as in `SimplePonzi.java`. This requires a
list of investors, of unbounded size. An implementation of this gradual
Ponzi contract is reported below and has been
inspired by a similar Ethereum contract from Iyer and Dannen,
shown at page 150 of [[IyerD08]](#references).
Write its code inside package `it.takamaka.ponzi` of
the `ponzi` project, as a new class `GradualPonzi.java`:

```java
package io.takamaka.ponzi;

import static io.takamaka.code.lang.Takamaka.require;

import java.math.BigInteger;

import io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.FromContract;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.Payable;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.PayableContract;
import io.takamaka.code.util.StorageLinkedList;
import io.takamaka.code.util.StorageList;

public class GradualPonzi extends Contract {
  public final BigInteger MINIMUM_INVESTMENT = BigInteger.valueOf(1_000L);

  /**
   * All investors up to now. This list might contain the same investor many times,
   * which is important to pay him back more than investors who only invested once.
   */
  private final StorageList<PayableContract> investors = new StorageLinkedList<>();

  public @FromContract(PayableContract.class) GradualPonzi() {
    investors.add((PayableContract) caller());
  }

  public @Payable @FromContract(PayableContract.class) void invest(BigInteger amount) {
    require(amount.compareTo(MINIMUM_INVESTMENT) >= 0,
      () -> "you must invest at least " + MINIMUM_INVESTMENT);
    BigInteger eachInvestorGets = amount.divide(BigInteger.valueOf(investors.size()));
    investors.stream().forEachOrdered(investor -> investor.receive(eachInvestorGets));
    investors.add((PayableContract) caller());
  }
}
```

The constructor of `GradualPonzi` is annotated as `@FromContract`, hence
it can only be
called by a contract, that gets added, as first investor,
in the `io.takamaka.code.util.StorageLinkedList` held in field `investors`.
This list, that implements an unbounded list of objects,
is a storage object, as long as only storage objects are
added inside it. `PayableContract`s are storage objects, hence
its use is correct here.
Subsequently, other contracts can invest by calling method `invest()`.
A minimum investment is required, but this remains constant over time.
The `amount` invested gets split by the number of the previous investors
and sent back to each of them. Note that Takamaka allows programmers to use
Java 8 lambdas and streams.
Old fashioned Java programmers, who don't feel at home with such treats,
can exploit the fact that
storage lists are iterable and replace the single-line `forEachOrdered()` call
with a more traditional (but gas-hungrier):

```java
for (PayableContract investor: investors)
  investor.receive(eachInvestorGets);
```

It is instead **highly discouraged** to iterate the list as if it were an
array. Namely, **do not write**

```java
for (int pos = 0; pos < investors.size(); pos++)
  investors.get(i).receive(eachInvestorGets);
```

since linked lists are not random-access data structures and the complexity of the
last loop is quadratic in the size of the list. This is not a novelty: the
same occurs with many traditional Java lists, that do not implement
`java.util.RandomAccess` (a notable example is `java.util.LinkedList`).
In Takamaka, code execution costs gas and
computational complexity does matter, more than in other programming contexts.

### A Note on Re-entrancy

The `GradualPonzi.java` class pays back previous investors immediately:
as soon as a new investor invests something, his investment gets
split and forwarded to all previous investors. This should
make Solidity programmers uncomfortable, since the same approach,
in Solidity, might lead to the infamous re-entrancy attack, when the
contract that receives his investment back has a
fallback function redefined in such a way to re-enter the paying contract and
re-execute the distribution of the investment.
As it is well known, such an attack has made some people rich and other
desperate. You can find more detail
at page 173 of [[AntonopoulosW19]](#references).
Even if such a frightening scenario does not occur,
paying back previous investors immediately is discouraged in Solidity
also for other reasons. Namely, the contract that receives his
investment back might have a redefined fallback function that
consumes too much gas or does not terminate. This would hang the
loop that pays back previous investors, actually locking the
money inside the `GradualPonzi` contract. Moreover, paying back
a contract is a relatively expensive operation in Solidity, even if the
fallback function is not redefined, and this cost is paid by the
new investor that called `invest()`, in terms of gas. The cost is linear
in the number of investors that must be paid back.

As a solution to these problems, Solidity programmers do not pay previous
investors back immediately, but let the `GradualPonzi` contract take
note of the balance of each investor, through a map.
This map is updated as soon as a new investor arrives, by increasing the
balance of every previous investor. The cost of updating the balances
is still linear in the number of previous investors, but it is cheaper
(in Solidity) than sending money back to each of them, which
requires expensive inter-contract calls that trigger new subtransactions.
With this technique, previous investors are
now required to withdraw their balance explicitly and voluntarily,
through a call to some function, typically called `widthdraw()`.
This leads to the *withdrawal pattern*, widely used for writing Solidity contracts.

We have not used the withdrawal pattern in `GradualPonzi.java`. In general,
there is no need for such pattern in Takamaka, at least not for simple
contracts like `GradualPonzi.java`. The reason is that the
`receive()` methods of a payable contract (corresponding to the
fallback function of Solidity) are `final` in Takamaka and very cheap
in terms of gas. In particular, inter-contract calls are not
especially expensive in Takamaka, since they are just a method
invocation in Java bytecode (one bytecode instruction). They are *not* inner transactions.
They are actually cheaper than
updating a map of balances. Moreover, avoiding the `widthdraw()` transactions
means reducing the overall number of transactions;
without using the map supporting the withdrawal pattern, Takamaka contracts
consume less gas and less storage.
Hence, the withdrawal pattern is both
useless in Takamaka and more expensive than paying back previous contracts immediately.

### Running the Gradual Ponzi Contract

Let us play with the `GradualPonzi` contract now.
Run, inside that `ponzi` project, the command `mvn package`.
A file `ponzi-0.0.1.jar` should appear inside `target`.
We can now start by installing that jar in the node:

```shell
$ cd hotmoka_tutorial   # if not already there
$ moka install ponzi/target/ponzi-0.0.1.jar
    --payer @account1
    --url @server

Please specify the password of the payer account: chocolate
Do you really want to spend up to 697300 gas units to install the jar [Y/N] Y

ponzi/target/ponzi-0.0.1.jar has been installed at
@gradual_ponzi_address
```

We create two more accounts now, letting our first account pay:

```shell
$ moka create-account
    10000000
    --payer @account1
    --url @server

Please specify the password of the payer account: chocolate
Please specify the password of the new account: orange
Do you really want to spend up to 200000 gas units to create a new account [Y/N] Y
Total gas consumed: 44574
  for CPU: 401
  for RAM: 1352
  for storage: 42821
  for penalty: 0

A new account @account2
has been created.
Its entropy has been saved into the file
"@account2.pem".
Please take note of the following passphrase of 36 words...

$ moka create-account
    10000000
    --payer @account1
    --url @server

Please specify the password of the payer account: chocolate
Please specify the password of the new account: apple
Do you really want to spend up to 200000 gas units to create a new account [Y/N] Y
Total gas consumed: 44574
  for CPU: 401
  for RAM: 1352
  for storage: 42821
  for penalty: 0

A new account @account3
has been created.
Its entropy has been saved into the file
"@account3.pem".
Please take note of the following passphrase of 36 words...
```

We let our first account create an instance of `GradualPonzi` in the node now
and become the first investor of the contract:

```shell
$ moka create
    io.takamaka.ponzi.GradualPonzi
    --payer @account1
    --classpath @gradual_ponzi_address
    --url @server

Please specify the password of the payer account: chocolate
Do you really want to spend up to 500000 gas units to call
@FromContract(PayableContract.class) public GradualPonzi() ? [Y/N] Y

The new object has been allocated at
@gradual_ponzi_object
```

We let the other two players invest, in sequence, in the `GradualPonzi` contract:

```shell
$ moka call
    @gradual_ponzi_object
    invest 5000
    --payer @account2
    --url @server

Please specify the password of the payer account: orange
Do you really want to spend up to 500000 gas units to call
public void invest(java.math.BigInteger) ? [Y/N] Y

$ moka call
    @gradual_ponzi_object
    invest 15000
    --payer @account3
    --url @server

Please specify the password of the payer account: apple
Do you really want to spend up to 500000 gas units to call
public void invest(java.math.BigInteger) ? [Y/N] Y
```

We let the first player try to invest again in the contract, this time
with a too small investment, which leads to an exception,
since the code of the contract requires a minimum investment:

```shell
$ moka call
    @gradual_ponzi_object
    invest 500
    --payer @account1
    --url @server

Please specify the password of the payer account: chocolate
Do you really want to spend up to 500000 gas units to call
public void invest(java.math.BigInteger) ? [Y/N] Y

io.hotmoka.beans.TransactionException:
io.takamaka.code.lang.RequirementViolationException:
you must invest at least 1000@GradualPonzi.java:46
```

This exception states that a transaction failed because the last
investor invested less than 1000 units of coin. Note that the
exception message reports the cause (a `require` failed)
and includes the source program line
of the contract where the exception occurred:
line 46 of `GradualPonzi.java`, that is

```java
require(amount.compareTo(MINIMUM_INVESTMENT) >= 0,
  () -> "you must invest at least " + MINIMUM_INVESTMENT);
```

Finally, we can check the state of the contract:

```shell
$ moka state @gradual_ponzi_object
    --url @server

This is the state of object
@gradual_ponzi_object
@@server

class io.takamaka.ponzi.GradualPonzi (from jar installed at
    @gradual_ponzi_address)

  MINIMUM_INVESTMENT:java.math.BigInteger = 1000
  investors:io.takamaka.code.util.StorageList
    = @gradual_ponzi_list
  balance:java.math.BigInteger = 0 (inherited from io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract)
  balanceRed:java.math.BigInteger = 0 (inherited from io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract)
```
You can see that the contract keeps no balance. Moreover, its `investors` field is bound to an
object, whose state can be further investigated:

```shell
$ moka state @gradual_ponzi_list
    --url @server

This is the state of object
@gradual_ponzi_list
@@server

class io.takamaka.code.util.StorageLinkedList (from jar installed at
    @takamakaCode)

    = @gradual_ponzi_first
  last:io.takamaka.code.util.StorageLinkedList$Node
    = @gradual_ponzi_last
  size:int = 3
```
As you can see, it is a `StorageLinkedList` of size three, since it contains our three accounts that interacted with the
`GradualPonzi` contract instance.

## Storage Arrays

Arrays are an ordered sequence of elements, with constant-time access
to such elements, both for reading and for writing. The size of the arrays is typically
fixed, although there are programming languages with limited forms
of dynamic arrays.

Java has native arrays, of type `E[]`, where `E` is the
type of the elements of the array. They can be used in Takamaka, but not
as fields of storage classes. For that, Takamaka provides class
`io.takamaka.code.util.StorageTreeArray<E>`. Its instances are storage objects and
can consequently be held in fields of storage classes and
can be stored in the store of a Hotmoka node, *as long as only
storage objects are added to the array*. Their size is fixed and decided
at time of construction. Although we consider `StorageTreeArray<E>` as the storage
replacement for Java arrays, it must be stated that the complexity of
accessing their elements is logarithmic in the size of the array, which is
a significant deviation from the standard definition of arrays. Nevertheless,
logarithmic complexity is much better than the linear complexity for
accessing elements of a `StorageLinkedList<E>` that, instead, has the advantage
of being dynamic in size.

We refer to the JavaDoc of `StorageTreeArray<E>` for a full list of its methods.
They include methods for adding elements, for accessing and
removing elements, for iterating on an array and for building a Java array
`E[]` with the elements of a `StorageTreeArray<E>`.
Figure @fig:arrays_hierarchy shows the hierarchy of the `StorageTreeArray<E>` class.
It implements the interface `StorageArray<E>`, that defines the methods that modify an array.
That interface extends the interface `StorageArrayView<E>` that, instead, defines the methods
that read data from an array, but do not modify it. This distinction between the _read-only_
interface and the _modification_ interface is identical to what we have seen for lists in the previous
sections. Arrays have methods `snapshot()` and `view()` as well, like lists. They yield `@Exported`
storage arrays, both in constant time. All constructors of the `StorageTreeArray<E>` class require to specify the immutable
size of the array. Moreover, it is possible to specify a default value for the elements of the
array, that can be explicit or given as a supplier, possibly indexed.

Next section shows an example of use for `StorageTreeArray<E>`.

### A Tic-Tac-Toe Contract

__[See project `tictactoe` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

Tic-tac-toe is a game where two players place, alternately,
a cross and a circle on a 3x3 board, initially empty. The winner is the
player who places three crosses or three circles on the same row,
column or diagonal. For instance, in Figure @fig:cross_wins the player of
the cross wins.

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:cross_wins. Cross wins.](pics/tictactoe_wins.png "Figure @fig:cross_wins. Cross wins."){ width=30% }

There are games that end up in a draw, when the board is full but nobody wins,
as in Figure @fig:tictactoe_draw.

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="250" height="250" src="pics/tictactoe_draw.png" alt="Figure @fig:tictactoe_draw. A draw"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:tictactoe_draw. A draw.</p>

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:tictactoe_draw. A draw.](pics/tictactoe_draw.png "Figure @fig:tictactoe_draw. A draw."){ width=39% }

A natural representation of the tic-tac-toe board is a bidimensional array
where indexes are distributed as shown in Figure @fig:tictactoe_grid.

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="250" height="250" src="pics/tictactoe_grid.png" alt="Figure @fig:tictactoe_grid. A bidimensional representation of the game"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:tictactoe_grid. A bidimensional representation of the game.</p>

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:tictactoe_grid. A bidimensional representation of the game.](pics/tictactoe_grid.png "Figure @fig:tictactoe_grid. A bidimensional representation of the game."){ width=35% }

This can be implemented as a `StorageTreeArray<StorageTreeArray<Tile>>`, where `Tile` is
an enumeration of the three possible tiles (empty, cross, circle). This is
possible but overkill. It is simpler and cheaper (also in terms of gas)
to use the previous diagram as a conceptual representation of the board
shown to the users, but use, internally,
a monodimensional array of nine tiles, distributed as in Figure @fig:tictactoe_linear.
This monodimensional array can be implemented as a `StorageTreeArray<Tile>`. There will be functions
for translating the conceptual representation into the internal one.

Create hence in Eclipse a new Maven Java 11 (or later) project named `tictactoe`.
You can do this by duplicating the project `family` (make sure to store
the project inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` directory, as a sibling of `family`, `ponzi` and
`runs`). Use the following `pom.xml`:

```xml

```

and the following `module-info.java`:

```java
module tictactoe {
  requires io.takamaka.code;
}
```

Create package `io.takamaka.tictactoe` inside `src/main/java` and add
the following `TicTacToe.java` source inside that package:

```java
package io.takamaka.tictactoe;

import static io.takamaka.code.lang.Takamaka.require;
import static java.util.stream.Collectors.joining;
import static java.util.stream.IntStream.rangeClosed;

import java.math.BigInteger;

import io.takamaka.code.util.StorageTreeArray;

public class TicTacToe extends Contract {

  public enum Tile {
    EMPTY, CROSS, CIRCLE;

    @Override
    public String toString() {
      switch (this) {
      case EMPTY: return " ";
      case CROSS: return "X";
      default: return "O";
      }
    }

    private Tile nextTurn() {
      return this == CROSS ? CIRCLE : CROSS;
    }
  }

  private final StorageArray<Tile> board = new StorageTreeArray<>(9, Tile.EMPTY);

    require(1 <= x && x <= 3 && 1 <= y && y <= 3,
      "coordinates must be between 1 and 3");
    require(at(x, y) == Tile.EMPTY, "the selected tile is not empty");

    PayableContract player = (PayableContract) caller();

    if (turn == Tile.CROSS)
      if (crossPlayer == null)
        crossPlayer = player;

        require(amount >= previousBet,
          () -> "you must bet at least " + previousBet + " coins");
        circlePlayer = player;
      }
      else
        require(player == circlePlayer, "it's not your turn");

    set(x, y, turn);
    if (isGameOver(x, y))
      player.receive(balance());
    else
      turn = turn.nextTurn();
  }

  private boolean isGameOver(int x, int y) {
    return gameOver =
      rangeClosed(1, 3).allMatch(_y -> at(x, _y) == turn) || // column x
      rangeClosed(1, 3).allMatch(_x -> at(_x, y) == turn) || // row y
      (x == y && rangeClosed(1, 3).allMatch(_x -> at(_x, _x) == turn)) || // 1st diagonal
      (x + y == 4 && rangeClosed(1, 3).allMatch(_x -> at(_x, 4 - _x) == turn)); // 2nd
  }

  @Override
  public @View String toString() {
    return rangeClosed(1, 3)
      .mapToObj(y -> rangeClosed(1, 3)
                     .mapToObj(x -> at(x, y).toString())
                     .collect(joining("|")))
      .collect(joining("\n-----\n"));
  }
}
```

The internal enumeration `Tile` represents the three alternatives that can be
put in the tic-tac-toe board. It overrides the default
`toString()` implementation, to yield the
usual representation for such alternatives; its `nextTurn()` method
alternates between cross and circle.

> There is no need to make the `Tile` enumeration `static`, to save gas,
> since enumerations are always implicitly `static` in Java.

The board of the game is represented as a `new StorageTreeArray<>(9, Tile.EMPTY)`, whose
elements are indexed from 0 to 8 (inclusive) and are initialized to `Tile.EMPTY`.
It is also possible to construct the array as `new StorageTreeArray<>(9)`, but then
its elements would hold the default value `null` and the array would need to be initialized
inside a constructor for `TicTacToe`:

```java
public TicTacToe() {
  rangeClosed(0, 8).forEachOrdered(index -> board.set(index, Tile.EMPTY));
}
```

Methods `at()` and `set()` read and set the board element
at indexes (x,y), respectively. They transform the bidimensional conceptual representation
of the board into its internal monodimensional representation. Since `at()` is `public`,
we defensively check the validity of the indexes there.

Method `play()` is the heart of the contract. It is called by the accounts
that play the game, hence it is annotated as `@FromContract`. It is also annotated as
`@Payable(PayableContract.class)` since players must bet money for
taking part in the game, at least for the first two moves, and receive
money if they win. The first
contract that plays is registered as `crossPlayer`. The second contract
that plays is registered as `circlePlayer`. Subsequent moves must
come, alternately, from `crossPlayer` and `circlePlayer`. The contract
uses a `turn` variable to keep track of the current turn.

Note the extensive use of `require()` to check all error situations:

1. It is possible to play only if the game is not over yet.
2. A move must be inside the board and identify an empty tile.
3. Players must alternate correctly.
4. The second player must bet at least as much as the first player.
5. It is not allowed to play against oneself.

The `play()` method ends with a call to `gameOver()` that checks
if the game is over. In that case, the winner receives the full
jackpot. Note that the `gameOver()` method receives the coordinates
where the current player has moved. This allows it to restrict the
check for game over: the game is over only if the row or column
where the player moved contain the same tile; if the current player
played on a diagonal, the method checks the diagonals as well.
It is of course possible to check all rows, columns and diagonals, always,
but our solution is gas-thriftier.

The `toString()` method yields a string representation of the current board, such as

```
X|O| 
-----
 |X|O
-----
 |X| 
```

For those who do not appreciate Java 8 streams, the same result can be obtained with
a more traditional (and gas-hungrier) code:

```java
@Override
public @View String toString() {
  String result = "";
  for (int y = 0; y < 3; y++) {
    for (int x = 0; x < 3; x++) {
      result += at(x, y);
      if (x < 2)
        result += "|";
    }
    if (y < 2)
      result += "\n-----\n"
  }

  return result;
}
```

### A More Realistic Tic-Tac-Toe Contract

__[See project `tictactoe_improved` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

The `TicTacToe.java` code implements the rules of a tic-tac-toe game, but has
a couple of drawbacks that make it still incomplete. Namely:

1. The creator of the game must spend gas to call its constructor,
   but has no direct incentive in doing so. He must be a benefactor,
   or hope to take part in the game after creation, if he is faster than
   any other potential player.
2. If the game ends in a draw, money gets stuck in the `TicTacToe` contract
   instance, for ever and ever.

Replace hence the previous version of `TicTacToe.java` with the following
improved version. This new version solves
both problems at once. The policy is very simple: it imposes a minimum
bet, in order to avoid free games; if a winner emerges,
then the game forwards him only 90% of the jackpot; the remaining 10% goes to the
creator of the `TicTacToe` contract. If, instead, the game ends in a draw,
it forwards the whole jackpot to the creator.
Note that we added a `@FromContract` constructor, that takes
note of the `creator` of the game:

```java
package io.takamaka.tictactoe;

import static io.takamaka.code.lang.Takamaka.require;

### Running the Tic-Tac-Toe Contract

Let us play with the `TicTacToe` contract. Go inside the `tictactoe` project
and run the `mvn package` command. A file
`tictactoe-0.0.1.jar` should appear inside `target`.
Let us start by installing that jar in the node:

```shell
$ moka install tictactoe/target/tictactoe-0.0.1.jar
    --payer @account1
    --url @server

Please specify the password of the payer account: chocolate
Do you really want to spend up to 870600 gas units to install the jar [Y/N] Y

tictactoe/target/tictactoe-0.0.1.jar has been installed
at @tictactoe_address
```

Then we create an instance of the contract in the node:

```shell
$ moka create
    io.takamaka.tictactoe.TicTacToe
    --payer @account1
    --classpath @tictactoe_address
    --url @server

Please specify the password of the payer account: chocolate
Do you really want to spend up to 500000 gas units to call
@FromContract(PayableContract.class) public TicTacToe() ? [Y/N] Y

The new object has been allocated at
@tictactoe_object
```

We use two of our accounts now, that we have already created in the previous section,
to interact with the contract: they will play, alternately, until the first player wins.
We will print the `toString` of the contract after each move.

The first player starts, by playing at (1,1), and bets 100:

```shell
$ moka call
    @tictactoe_object
    play 100 1 1
    --payer @account1
    --url @server

$ moka call
    @tictactoe_object
    toString
    --payer @account1
    --url @server

X| | 
-----
 | | 
-----
 | | 
```

The second player plays after, at (2,1), betting 100:

```shell
$ moka call
    @tictactoe_object
    play 100 2 1
    --payer @account2
    --url @server

$ moka call
    @tictactoe_object
    toString
    --payer @account2
    --url @server

X|O| 
-----
 | | 
-----
 | | 

```

The first player replies, playing at (1,2):

```shell
$ moka call
    @tictactoe_object
    play 0 1 2
    --payer @account1
    --url @server

$ moka call
    @tictactoe_object
    toString
    --payer @account1
    --url @server

X|O| 
-----
X| | 
-----
 | | 
```

Then the second player plays at (2,2):

```shell
$ moka call
    @tictactoe_object
    play 0 2 2
    --payer @account2
    --url @server

$ moka call
    @tictactoe_object
    toString
    --payer @account2
    --url @server

X|O| 
-----
X|O| 
-----
 | | 
```

The first player wins by playing at (1,3):

```shell
$ moka call
    @tictactoe_object
    play 0 1 3
    --payer @account1
    --url @server

$ moka call
    @tictactoe_object
    toString
    --payer @account1
    --url @server

X|O| 
-----
X|O| 
-----
X| | 
```
We can verify that the game is over now:
```shell
$ moka state @tictactoe_object
    --url @server

This is the state of object
@tictactoe_object
@@server

class io.takamaka.tictactoe.TicTacToe (from jar installed at
    @tictactoe_address)

  ...
  gameOver:boolean = true
  balance:java.math.BigInteger = 0 (inherited from io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract)
  ...
```
As you can see, the balance of the contract is zero since it has been distributed to
the winner and to the creator of the game (that actually coincide, in this specific run).

If the second player attempts to play now, the transaction will be rejected, since the game is over:

```shell
$ moka call
    @tictactoe_object
    play 0 2 3
    --payer @account2
    --url @server

io.hotmoka.beans.TransactionException:
io.takamaka.code.lang.RequirementViolationException:
the game is over@TicTacToe.java:79
```

### Specialized Storage Array Classes

The `StorageTreeArray<E>` class is very general, since it can be used to hold
any type `E` of storage values. Since it uses generics,
primitive values cannot be held in a `StorageTreeArray<E>`, directly.
For instance, `StorageTreeArray<byte>` is not legal syntax in Java.
Instead, one could think to use `StorageTreeArray<Byte>`, where `Byte`
is the Java wrapper class `java.lang.Byte`. However, that class is not
currently allowed in storage, hence `StorageTreeArray<Byte>` will not work either.
One should hence define a new wrapper class for `byte`, that extends `Storage`.
That is possible, but highly discouraged:
the use of wrapper classes introduces a level of indirection
and requires the instantiation of many small objects, which costs gas. Instead,
Takamaka provides specialized storage classes implementing arrays of bytes,
without wrappers. The rationale is that such arrays arise
naturally when dealing, for instance, with hashes or encrypted data
(see next section for an example) and consequently deserve
a specialized and optimized implementation.
Such specialized array classes
can have their length specified at construction time, or fixed to
a constant (for best optimization and minimal gas consumption).

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:byte_array_hierarchy. Specialized byte array classes.](pics/bytes.png "Figure @fig:byte_array_hierarchy. Specialized byte array classes.")

Figure @fig:byte_array_hierarchy shows the hierarchy of the specialized classes for arrays of bytes,
available in Takamaka.
The interface `StorageByteArrayView` defines the methods that read data from an array
of bytes, while the interface `StorageByteArray` defines the modification methods.
Class `StorageTreeByteArray` allows one to create byte arrays of any length,
specified at construction time.
Classes `Bytes32` and `Bytes32Snapshot` have, instead, fixed length of 32 bytes;
their constructors include one that allows one to specify such 32 bytes,
which is useful for calling the constructor from outside the node,
since `byte` is a storage type.
While a `Bytes32` is modifiable, instances of class `Bytes32Snapshot`
are not modifiable after being created and are `@Exported`.
There are sibling classes for different, fixed sizes, such as
`Bytes64` and `Bytes8Snaphot`. For a full description of the methods
of these classes and interfaces, we refer to their JavaDoc.

## Storage Maps

Maps are dynamic associations of objects to objects. They are useful
for programming smart contracts, as their extensive use in Solidity proves.
However, most such uses are related to the withdrawal pattern, that is
not needed in Takamaka. Nevertheless, there are still situations when
maps are useful in Takamaka code, as we show below.

Java has many implementations of maps, that can be used in Takamaka.
However, they are not storage objects and consequently cannot be
stored in a Hotmoka node. This section describes the
`io.takamaka.code.util.StorageTreeMap<K,V>` class, that extends `Storage` and
whose instances can then be held in the store of a node, if keys `K` and
values `V` can be stored in a node as well.

We refer to the JavaDoc of `StorageTreeMap` for a full description of its methods,
that are similar to those of traditional Java maps. Here, we just observe
that a key is mapped into a value by calling method
`void put(K key, V value)`, while the value bound to a key is retrieved by calling
`V get(Object key)`. It is possible to yield a default value when a key is not
in the map, by calling `V getOrDefault(Object key, V _default)` or
its sibling `V getOrDefault(Object key, Supplier<? extends V> _default)`, that
evaluates the default value only if needed. Method `V putIfAbsent(K key, V value)`,
binds the key to the value only if the key is unbound. Similarly for
its sibling `V computeIfAbsent(K key, Supplier<? extends V> value)` that, however,
evaluates the new value only if needed (these two methods differ for their
returned value, as in Java maps. Please refer to their JavaDoc).

Instances of `StorageTreeMap<K,V>` keep keys in increasing order. Namely, if
type `K` has a natural order, that order is used. Otherwise, keys
(that must be storage objects) are kept ordered by increasing storage
reference. Consequently, methods `K min()` and `K max()` yield the
minimal and the maximal key of a map. Method `List<K> keyList()` yields the
ordered list of the keys of a map; method `Stream<K> keys()` yields the
same, as an ordered stream; method `Stream<Entry<K,V>> stream()` yields the
ordered stream of the entries (ie., key/value pairs) of a map;
method `Stream<V> values()` yields the ordered stream of the values bound
to the keys of the map.

> Compare this with Solidity, where maps do not know the set of their keys nor the
> set of their values.

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:map_hierarchy. The hierarchy of storage maps.](pics/maps.png "Figure @fig:map_hierarchy. The hierarchy of storage maps.")

Figure @fig:map_hierarchy shows the hierarchy of the `StorageTreeMap<K,V>` class.
It implements the interface `StorageMap<K,V>`, that defines the methods that modify a map.
That interface extends the interface `StorageMapView<K,V>` that, instead, defines the methods
that read data from a map, but do not modify it.
Methods `snapshot()` and `view()` return an `@Exported` `StorageMapView<K,V>`, in constant time.

There are also specialized map classes, optimized
for specific primitive types of keys, such as `StorageTreeIntMap<V>`,
whose keys are `int` values. We refer to their JavaDoc for further information.

### A Blind Auction Contract

__[See project `auction` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

This section exemplifies the use of class `StorageTreeMap` for writing a smart
contract that implements a _blind auction_. That contract allows
a _beneficiary_ to sell an item to the buying contract that offers
the highest bid. Since data in blockchain is public, in a non-blind
auction it is possible that bidders eavesdrop the offers of other bidders
in order to place an offer that is only slightly higher than the current
best offer. A blind auction, instead, uses a two-phases
mechanism: in the initial _bidding time_, bidders place bids, hashed, so that
they do not reveal their amount. After the bidding time expires, the second
phase, called _reveal time_, allows bidders to
reveal the real values of their bids and the auction contract to determine
the actual winner.
This works since, to reveal a bid, each bidder provides the real data
of the bid. The auction contract then recomputes the hash from real data and
checks if the result matches the hash provided at bidding time.
If not, the bid is considered invalid. Bidders can even place fake offers
on purpose, in order to confuse other bidders.

Create in Eclipse a new Maven Java 11 (or later) project named `auction`.
You can do this by duplicating the project `family` (make sure to store
the project inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` directory, as a sibling of `family`, `ponzi`, `tictactoe` and
`runs`). Use the following `pom.xml`:

```xml

```

and the following `module-info.java`:

```java
module auction {
  requires io.takamaka.code;
}
```

Create package `io.takamaka.auction` inside `src/main/java` and add
the following `BlindAuction.java` inside that package.
It is a Takamaka contract that implements
a blind auction. Since each bidder may place more bids and since such bids
must be kept in storage until reveal time, this code uses a map
from bidders to lists of bids. This smart contract has been inspired
by a similar Solidity contract [[BlindAuction]](#references).
Please note that this code will not compile yet, since it misses two classes
that we will define in the next section.

Let us discuss this (long) code, by starting from the inner classes.

Class `Bid` represents a bid placed by a contract that takes part to the auction.
This information will be stored in blockchain at bidding time, hence
it is known to all other participants. An instance of `Bid` contains
the `deposit` paid at time of placing the bid. This is not necessarily
the real value of the offer but must be at least as large as the real offer,
or otherwise the bid will be considered as invalid at reveal time. Instances
of `Bid` contain a `hash` consisting of 32 bytes. As already said, this will
be recomputed at reveal time and matched against the result.
Since arrays cannot be stored in blockchain, we use the storage class
`io.takamaka.code.util.Bytes32Snapshot` here, a library class that holds 32 bytes, as a
traditional array (see [Specialized Storage Array Classes](#specialized-storage-array-classes)).
It is well possible to use a `StorageArray` of a wrapper
of `byte` here, but `Bytes32Snapshot` is much more compact and its methods consume less gas.

Class `RevealedBid` describes a bid revealed after bidding time.
It contains the real value of the bid, the salt used to strengthen the
hashing algorithm and a boolean `fake` that, when true, means that the
bid must be considered as invalid, since it was only placed in order
to confuse other bidders. It is possible to recompute and check the hash of
a revealed bid through method `Bid.matches()`, that uses a given
hashing algorithm (`digest`, a Java `java.security.MessageDigest`) to
hash value, fake mark and salt into bytes, finally compared
against the hash provided at bidding time.

The `BlindAuction` contract stores the `beneficiary` of the auction.
It is the contract that created the auction and is consequently
initialized, in the constructor of `BlindAuction`, to its caller.
The constructor must be annotated as `@FromContract` because of that.
The same constructor receives the length of bidding time and reveal time, in
milliseconds. This allows the contract to compute tha absolute ending time
for the bidding phase and for the reveal phase, stored into fields
`biddingEnd` and `revealEnd`, respectively.
Note, in the constructor of `BlindAuction`, the
use of the static method `io.takamaka.code.lang.Takamaka.now()`, that yields the
current time, as with the traditional `System.currentTimeMillis()` of Java
(that instead cannot be used in Takamaka code). Method `now()`, in a blockchain, yields the
time of creation of the block of the current transaction, as seen by its miner.
That time is reported in the block and hence is independent from the
machine that runs the contract, which guarantees determinism.

Method `bid()` allows a caller (the bidder) to place a bid during the bidding phase.
An instance of `Bid` is created and added to a list, specific to each
bidder. Here is where our map comes to help. Namely, field
`bids` holds a `StorageTreeMap<PayableContract, StorageList<Bid>>`,
that can be held in the store of a node since it is a storage map between storage keys
and storage values. Method `bid()` computes an empty list of bids if it is the
first time that a bidder places a bid. For that, it uses method
`computeIfAbsent()` of `StorageMap`. If it used method `get()`, it would
run into a null-pointer exception the first time a bidder places a bid.
That is, storage maps default to `null`, as all Java maps. (But differently to
Solidity maps, that provide a new value automatically when undefined.)

Method `reveal()` is called by each bidder during the reveal phase.
It accesses the `bids` placed by the bidder during the bidding time.
The method matches each revealed bid against the corresponding
list of bids for the player, by calling
method `refundFor()`, that determines how much of the deposit must be
refunded to the bidder. Namely, if a bid was fake or was not the best bid,
it must be refunded in full. If it was the best bid, it must be partially refunded
if the apparent `deposit` turns out to be higher than the actual value of the
revealed bid. While bids are refunded, method `placeBid` updates
the best bid information.

Method `auctionEnd()` is meant to be called after the reveal phase.
If there is a winner, it sends the highest bid to the beneficiary.

Note the use of methods `onlyBefore()` and `onlyAfter()` to guarantee
that some methods are only run at the right moment.

### Events

__[See project `auction_events` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

The code in the previous section does not compile since it misses two
classes `BidIncrease.java` and `AuctionEnd.java`, that we report below.
Namely, the code of the blind auction contract contains some lines that generate
_events_, such as:

```java
event(new AuctionEnd(winner, highestBid));
```

Events are milestones that are saved in the store of a Hotmoka node.
From outside the node, it is possible to subscribe to specific events and get
notified as soon as an event of that kind occurs,
to trigger actions when that happens. In terms of the
Takamaka language, events are generated through the
`io.takamaka.code.lang.Takamaka.event(Event event)` method, that receives a parameter
of type `io.takamaka.code.lang.Event`. The latter is simply an abstract class that
extends `Storage`. Hence, events will
be stored in the node as part of the transaction that generated that event.
The constructor of class `Event` is annotated as `FromContract`, which allows one
to create events from the code of contracts only. The creating contract is available
through method `creator()` of class `Event`.

In our example, the `BlindAuction` class uses two events, that you can add
to the `io.takamaka.auction` package and are defined as follows:

```java
package io.takamaka.auction;

import java.math.BigInteger;

import io.takamaka.code.lang.FromContract;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.Event;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.PayableContract;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.View;

public class BidIncrease extends Event {
  public final PayableContract bidder;
  public final BigInteger amount;

  @FromContract BidIncrease(PayableContract bidder, BigInteger amount) {
    this.bidder = bidder;
    this.amount = amount;
  }

  public @View PayableContract getBidder() {
    return bidder;
  }

  public @View BigInteger getAmount() {
    return amount;
  }
}
```

and

```java
package io.takamaka.auction;

import java.math.BigInteger;

import io.takamaka.code.lang.FromContract;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.Event;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.PayableContract;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.View;

public class AuctionEnd extends Event {
  public final PayableContract highestBidder;
  public final BigInteger highestBid;

  @FromContract AuctionEnd(PayableContract highestBidder, BigInteger highestBid) {
    this.highestBidder = highestBidder;
    this.highestBid = highestBid;
  }

  public @View PayableContract getHighestBidder() {
    return highestBidder;
  }

  public @View BigInteger getHighestBid() {
  return highestBid;
  }
}

```

Now that all classes have been completed, the project should compile.
Go inside the `auction` project and
run `mvn package`. A file `auction-0.0.1.jar` should appear inside `target`.

This test class is relatively long and complex. Let us start from its beginning.
The code specifies that the test will place 10 random bids, that the bidding phase
lasts 130 seconds and that the reveal phase lasts 170 seconds
(these timings are fine on a blockchain that creates a block every five seconds;
shorter block creation times allow shorter timings):

```java
public final static int NUM_BIDS = 10;
public final static int BIDDING_TIME = 130_000;
public final static int REVEAL_TIME = 170_000;
```

Some constant signatures follow,
that simplify the calls to methods and constructors later.
Method `main()` connects to a remote node and passes it
as a parameter to the constructor of class `Auction`, that
installs `auction-0.0.1.jar` inside it. It stores the node in field `node`.
Then the constructor of `Auction` creates an `auction` contract in the node
and calls method `placeBids()` that
uses the inner class `BidToReveal` to keep track of the bids placed
during the test, in clear. Initially, bids are kept in
memory, not in the store of the node, where they could be publicly accessed.
Only their hashes are stored in the node.
Method `placeBids()` generates `NUM_BIDS` random bids on behalf
of the `accounts.length -1` players (the first element of the
`accounts` array is the creator of the auction):

```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= NUM_BIDS) {
  int player = 1 + random.nextInt(accounts.length - 1);
  BigInteger deposit = BigInteger.valueOf(random.nextInt(1000));
  BigInteger value = BigInteger.valueOf(random.nextInt(1000));
  boolean fake = random.nextBoolean();
  byte[] salt = new byte[32];
  random.nextBytes(salt);
  ...
}
```

Each random bid is hashed (including a random salt) and a `Bytes32Snapshot` object
is created in the store of the node, containing that hash:

```java
StorageReference bytes32 = codeAsBytes32(player, value, fake, salt);
```

The bid, in clear, is added to a list `bids` that, at the end of the loop,
will contain all bids:

```java
bids.add(new BidToReveal(player, value, fake, salt));
```

The hash is used instead to place a bid in the node:

```java
node.addInstanceMethodCallTransaction(new InstanceMethodCallTransactionRequest
  (signers[player], accounts[player],
  nonceHelper.getNonceOf(accounts[player]), chainId,
  _500_000, panarea(gasHelper.getSafeGasPrice()), classpath, BID,
  auction, new BigIntegerValue(deposit), bytes32));
```

The loop takes also care of keeping track of the best bidder, that placed
the best bid, so that it can be compared at the end with the best bidder
computed by the smart contract (they should coincide):

```java
if (!fake && deposit.compareTo(value) >= 0)
  if (expectedWinner == null || value.compareTo(maxBid) > 0) {
    maxBid = value;
    expectedWinner = accounts[player];
  }
  else if (value.equals(maxBid))
    continue;
```

As you can see, the test above avoids generating a bid that
is equal to the best bid seen so far. This avoids having two bidders
that place the same bid: the smart contract will consider as winner
the first bidder that reveals its bids. To avoid this tricky case, we prefer
to assume that the best bid is unique. This is just a simplification of the
testing code, since the smart contract deals perfectly with that case.

After all bids have been placed, the constructor of `Auction` waits until the end of
the bidding time:

```java
waitUntilEndOfBiddingTime();
```

Then the constructor of `Auction` calls method `revealBids()`, that reveals
the bids to the smart contract, in plain. It creates in the store of the node
a data structure
`RevealedBid` for each elements of the list `bids`, by calling
`bid.intoBlockchain()`.
This creates the bid in clear in the store of the node, but this is safe now,
since the bidding time is over and
they cannot be used to guess a winning bid anymore. Then method `revealBids()`
reveals the bids by calling method `reveal()` of the
smart contract:

```java
for (BidToReveal bid: bids) {
  int player = bid.player;
  StorageReference bidInBlockchain = bid.intoBlockchain();
  node.addInstanceMethodCallTransaction(new InstanceMethodCallTransactionRequest
    (signers[player], accounts[player],
    nonceHelper.getNonceOf(accounts[player]), chainId, _500_000,
    panarea(gasHelper.getSafeGasPrice()),
    classpath, REVEAL, auction, bidInBlockchain));
}
```

Note that this is possible since the inner class `RevealedBid` of the
smart contract has been annotated as `@Exported`
(see its code in section [A Blind Auction Contract](#a-blind-auction-contract)),
hence its instances can be
passed as argument to calls from outside the blockchain.

Subsequently, the constructor of `Auction` waits until the end of the reveal phase:

```java
waitUntilEndOfRevealTime();
```

After that, method `askForWinner()`
signals to the smart contract that the auction is over and asks about the winner:

```java
StorageValue winner = node.addInstanceMethodCallTransaction
  (new InstanceMethodCallTransactionRequest
  (signers[0], accounts[0], nonceHelper.getNonceOf(accounts[0]),
  chainId, _500_000, panarea(gasHelper.getSafeGasPrice()),
  classpath, AUCTION_END, auction));
```

The final two `System.out.println()`'s in the constructor of `Auction`
allow one to verify that the smart contract
actually computes the right winner, since they will always print the identical storage
object (different at each run, in general), such as:

```
expected winner: @account3
actual winner: @account3
```

You can run class `Auction` from Eclipse.
Please remember that the execution of this test will take a few minutes. Moreover,
remember to put your accounts at the beginning of `Auction.java` and ensure that they have enough
balance for this long execution.
Its execution should print something like this on the console:

```
Installing jar
Creating contract
Placing bid 1
Placing bid 2
Placing bid 3
...
Placing bid 10
Revealing bid 1 out of 20
Revealing bid 2 out of 20
Revealing bid 3 out of 20
...
Revealing bid 10 out of 10
expected winner: @account2
actual winner: @account2
```

### Listening to Events

__[See project `runs` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

The `BlindAuction` contract generates events during its execution. If an external tool, such
as a wallet, wants to listen to such events and trigger some activity when they occur,
it is enough for it to subscribe to the events of a node that is executing the contract,
by providing a handler that gets executed each time a new event gets generated.
Subscription requires to specify the creator of the events that should be forwarded to the
handler. In our case, this is the `auction` contract. Thus, clone the `Auction.java` class into
`Events.java` and modify its constructor as follows:

```java
...
import io.hotmoka.nodes.Node.Subscription;
...
auction = createAuction();
start = System.currentTimeMillis();

try (Subscription subscription = node.subscribeToEvents(auction,
  (creator, event) -> System.out.println
    ("Seen event of class " + node.getClassTag(event).clazz.name
     + " created by contract " + creator))) {

  StorageReference expectedWinner = placeBids();
  waitUntilEndOfBiddingTime();
  revealBids();
  waitUntilEndOfRevealTime();
  StorageValue winner = askForWinner();

  System.out.println("expected winner: " + expectedWinner);
  System.out.println("actual winner: " + winner);
}
...
```

The event handler, in this case, simply prints on the console the class of the event and its creator
(that will coincide with `auction`).

If you run the `Events` class,
you should see something like this on the console:

```
Seen event of class io.takamaka.auction.BidIncrease
  created by contract 310d241d1f5dbe955f25ede96be324ade...#0
Seen event of class io.takamaka.auction.BidIncrease
  created by contract 310d241d1f5dbe955f25ede96be324ade...#0
Seen event of class io.takamaka.auction.BidIncrease
  created by contract 310d241d1f5dbe955f25ede96be324ade...#0
Seen event of class io.takamaka.auction.AuctionEnd
  created by contract 310d241d1f5dbe955f25ede96be324ade...#0
```

> The `subscribeToEvents()` method returns a `Subscription` object that should be
> closed when it is not needed anymore, in order to reduce the overhead on the node.
> Since it is an `AutoCloseable` resource, the recommended technique is to use a
> try-with-resource construct, as shown in the previous example.

In general, event handlers can perform arbitrarily complex operations and even access the
event object in the store of the node,
from its storage reference, reading its fields or calling its methods. Please remember, however,
that event handlers are run in a thread of the node. Hence, they should be fast and shouldn't hang.
It is good practice to let event handlers add events in a queue, in a non-blocking way.
A consumer thread, external to the node, then retrieves the events from the queue and process them in turn.

It is possible to subscribe to _all_ events generated by a node,
by using `null` as creator in the `subscribeToEvents()` method. Think twice before doing that,
since your handler will be notified of _all_ events generated by _any_ application installed in
the node. It might be a lot.

# Tokens

A popular class of smart contracts
implement a dynamic ledger of coin transfers between accounts. These
coins are not native tokens, but rather new, derived tokens.
In some sense, tokens are programmed money, whose rules are specified
by a smart contract and enforced by the underlying blockchain.

> In this context, the term _token_ is used
> for the smart contract that tracks coin transfers, for the single coin units and for the category
> of similar coins. This is sometime confusing.

Native and derived tokens can be categorized in many
ways [[OliveiraZBS18](#references),[Freni20](#references),[Tapscott20](#references)].
The most popular classification
is between _fungible_ and _non-fungible_ tokens.
Fungible tokens are interchangeable with each other, since they have an identical
nominal value that does not depend on each specific token instance.
Native tokens and traditional (_fiat_) currencies are both fungible tokens.
Their main application is in the area of crowdfunding and initial coin offers
to support startups.
On the contrary, non-fungible tokens have a value that depends on their specific instance.
Hence, in general, they are not interchangeable.
Their main application is currently in the art market, where they represent
a written declaration of author's rights concession to the holder.

A few standards have emerged for such tokens,
that should guarantee correctness,
accessibility, interoperability, management and security
of the smart contracts that run the tokens.
Among them, the Ethereum Requests for Comment \#20
(ERC-20, see <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20</a>)
and \#721
(ERC-721, see <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721</a>)
are the most popular, also outside Ethereum.
They provide developers with
a list of rules required for the correct integration of tokens
with other smart contracts and with applications external to the blockchain,
such as wallets, block explorers, decentralized finance protocols and games.

The most popular implementations of the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards are in Solidity,
by OpenZeppelin
(see <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/erc20">https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/erc20</a>
and <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/erc721">https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/erc721</a>),
a team of programmers in the Ethereum community
who deliver useful and secure smart contracts and libraries, and by
ConsenSys, later deprecated in favor of OpenZeppelin's.
OpenZeppelin extends ERC-20 with snapshots, that is,
immutable views of the state of a token contract, that show
its ledger at a specific instant of time.
They are useful to investigate the consequences of an attack, to create forks of the token
and to implement mechanisms based on token balances such as weighted voting.

## Fungible Tokens (ERC20)

A fungible token ledger is a ledger that binds owners (contracts) to
the numerical amount of tokens they own. With this very high-level description,
it is an instance of the `IERC20View` interface in Figure @fig:erc20_hierarchy.
The `balanceOf` method tells how many tokens an `account` holds and the method
`totalSupply` provides the total number of tokens in circulation.
The `UnsignedBigInteger` class is a Takamaka library class that wraps a `BigInteger`
and guarantees that its value is never negative. For instance, the subtraction of two
`UnsignedBigInteger`s throws an exception when the second is larger than the first.

The `snapshot` method, as already seen for collection classes, yields a read-only,
frozen view of the token ledger. Since it is defined in the topmost interface, all token classes
can be snapshotted. Snapshots are computable in constant time and their construction
does not affect other users of the ledger.

An ERC20 ledger is typically modifiable. Namely, owners
can sell tokens to other owners
and can delegate trusted contracts to transfer tokens on their behalf.
Of course, these operations must be legal, in the sense that a owner cannot sell
more tokens than it owns and delegated contracts cannot transfer more tokens than the
cap to their delegation.
These modification operations are defined in the
`IERC20` interface in Figure @fig:erc20_hierarchy. They are identical to the same
operations in the ERC20 standard for Ethereum, hence we refer to that standard for further detail.
The `view()` method is used to yield a _view_ of the ledger, that is, an object
that reflects the current state of the original ledger, but without any modification operation.

The `ERC20` implementation provides a standard implementation for the functions defined
in the `IERC20View` and `IERC20` interfaces. Moreover, it provides metadata information
such as the name, symbol and number of decimals for the specific token implementation.
There are protected implementations for methods that allow one to mint or burn an amount
of tokens for a given owner (`account`). These are protected since one does not
want to allow everybody to print or burn money. Instead, subclasses can call into these
methods in their constructor, to implement an initial distribution of tokens,
and can also allow subsequent, controlled mint or burns.
For instance, the `ERC20Burnable` class is an `ERC20` implementation that
allows a token owner to burn its tokens only, or those it has been
delegated to transfer, but never those of another owner.

The `ERC20Capped` implementation allows the specification of a maximal cap to the
number of tokens in circulation. When new tokens get minted, it checks that the cap
is not exceeded and throws an exception otherwise.

### Implementing Our Own ERC20 Token

__[See project `erc20` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

Let us define a token ledger class that allows only its creator the mint or burn tokens.
We will call it `CryptoBuddy`. As Figure @fig:erc20_hierarchy shows,
we plug it below the `ERC20` implementation, so that we inherit that implementation
and do not need to reimplement the methods of the `ERC20` interface.

Create in Eclipse a new Maven Java 11 (or later) project named `erc20`.
You can do this by duplicating the project `family` (make sure to store
the project inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` directory, as a sibling of `family`, `ponzi`, `tictactoe`
and so on). Use the following `pom.xml`:

```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
                        http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>io.hotmoka</groupId>

    <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target>
    <failOnMissingWebXml>false</failOnMissingWebXml>
  </properties>

  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.hotmoka</groupId>
      <artifactId>io-takamaka-code</artifactId>
      <version>@hotmoka_version</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.8.1</version>
          <configuration>
            <release>11</release>
          </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>

</project>
```

and the following `module-info.java`:

```java
module erc20 {
  requires io.takamaka.code;
}
```

Create package `io.takamaka.erc20` inside `src/main/java` and add
the following `CryptoBuddy.java` inside that package:

```java
package io.takamaka.erc20;

import static io.takamaka.code.lang.Takamaka.require;

import io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.FromContract;
import io.takamaka.code.math.UnsignedBigInteger;
import io.takamaka.code.tokens.ERC20;

public class CryptoBuddy extends ERC20 {
  private final Contract owner;

  public @FromContract CryptoBuddy() {
    super("CryptoBuddy", "CB");
    owner = caller();
    UnsignedBigInteger initialSupply = new UnsignedBigInteger("200000");
    UnsignedBigInteger multiplier = new UnsignedBigInteger("10").pow(18);
    _mint(caller(), initialSupply.multiply(multiplier)); // 200'000 * 10 ^ 18
  }

  public @FromContract void mint(Contract account, UnsignedBigInteger amount) {
    require(caller() == owner, "Lack of permission");
    _mint(account, amount);
  }

  public @FromContract void burn(Contract account, UnsignedBigInteger amount) {
    require(caller() == owner, "Lack of permission");
    _burn(account, amount);
  }
}
```

The constructor of `CryptoBuddy` initializes the total supply by minting
a very large number of tokens. They are initially owned by the creator of the contract,
that is saved as `owner`. Methods `mint` and `burn` check that the owner is requesting
the mint or burn and call the inherited protected methods in that case.

You can generate the `erc20-0.0.1.jar` file:

```shell
$ cd erc20
$ mvn package
```

Then you can install that jar in the node, by letting our first account pay:

```shell
$ cd ..
$ moka install erc20/target/erc20-0.0.1.jar
    --payer @account1
    --url @server

Please specify the password of the payer account: chocolate
Do you really want to spend up to 504100 gas units to install the jar [Y/N] Y
erc20/target/erc20-0.0.1.jar has been installed at
@erc20_address
Total gas consumed: 244568
  for CPU: 262
  for RAM: 1303
  for storage: 243003
  for penalty: 0
```

Finally, you can create an instance of the token class, by always letting our first account pay
for that:

```shell
$ moka create
  io.takamaka.erc20.CryptoBuddy
  --payer @account1
  --classpath @erc20_address
  --url @server

Please specify the password of the payer account: chocolate
Do you really want to spend up to 500000 gas units to call CryptoBuddy() ? [Y/N] Y
The new object has been allocated at
@erc20_object
Total gas consumed: 129369
  for CPU: 1314
  for RAM: 2843
  for storage: 125212
  for penalty: 0
```

The new ledger instance is installed in the storage of the node now, at the address
`@erc20_object`. It is possible to start interacting with that ledger instance, by transferring
tokens between accounts. For instance, this can be done with the `moka call` command,
that allows one to invoke the `transfer` or `transferFrom` methods of the ledger.
It is possible to show the state of the ledger with the `moka state` command, although specific
utilities will provide a more user-friendly view of the ledger in the future.

## Richer than Expected

Every owner of ERC20 tokens can decide to send some of its tokens to another
contract _C_, that will become an owner itself, if it was not already.
This means that the ledger inside
an `ERC20` implementation gets modified and some tokens get registered for
the new owner _C_. However, _C_ is not notified in any way of this transfer.
This means that our contracts could be richer than we expect, if somebody
has sent tokens to them, possibly inadvertently. In theory, we could
scan the whole memory of a Hotmoka node, looking for implementations
of the `IERC20` interface, and check if our contracts are registered inside them.
Needless to say, this is computationally irrealistic.
Moreover, even if we know that one of our contracts is waiting to receive
some tokens, we don't know immediately when this happens, since
the contract does not get notified of any transfer of tokens.

This issue is inherent to the definition of the ERC20 standard in Ethereum
and the implementation in Takamaka inherits this limitation, since it wants to stick
as much as possible to the Ethereum standard. A solution to the problem
would be to restrict the kind of owners that are allowed in Figure @fig:erc20_hierarchy.
Namely, instead of allowing all `Contract`s, the signature of the methods could
be restricted to owners of some interface type `IERC20Receiver`, with a single method
`onReceive` that gets called by the `ERC20` implementation, every time
tokens get transferred to an `IERC20Receiver`.
In this way, owners of ERC20 tokens get notified when they receive new tokens.
This solution has never been implemented for ERC20 tokens in Ethereum, while
it has been used in the ERC721 standard for non-fungible tokens, as we will
show in the next section.

## Non-Fungible Tokens (ERC721)

A non-fungible token is implemented as a ledger that maps each token identifier to its owner.
Ethereum provides the ERC721 specification for non-fungible tokens.
There, a token identifier is an array of bytes. Takamaka uses, more generically,
a `BigInteger`. Note that a `BigInteger` can be constructed from an array of bytes
by using the constructor of class `BigInteger` that receives an array of bytes.
In the ERC721 specification, token owners are contracts, although the implementation will check
that only contracts implementing the `IERC721Receiver` interface are added
to an `IERC721` ledger, or externally owned accounts.

> The reason for allowing externally owned accounts is probably a simplification,
> since Ethereum users own externally owned accounts and it is simpler for them
> to use such accounts directly inside an ERC721 ledger, instead of creating
> contracts of type `IERC721Receiver`. In any case, no other kind of contracts
> is allowed in ERC721 implementations.

The hierarchy of the Takamaka classes for the ERC721 standard is shown
in Figure @fig:erc721_hierarchy.

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="800" src="pics/erc721.png" alt="Figure @fig:erc721_hierarchy. The hierarchy of the ERC721 token implementations"></p>

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:erc721_hierarchy. The hierarchy of the ERC721 token implementations.](pics/erc721.png "Figure @fig:erc721_hierarchy. The hierarchy of the ERC721 token implementations."){ width=100% }

As in the case of the ERC20 tokens, the interface `IERC721View` contains
the read-only operations that implement a ledger of non-fungible
tokens: the `ownerOf` method yields the owner of a given token and
the `balanceOf` method returns the number of tokens held by a given `account`.
The `snapshot()` method allows one to create a frozen read-only view of a ledger.

The `IERC721` subinterface adds methods for token transfers.
Please refer to their description given by the Ethereum standard.
We just say here that
the `transferFrom` method moves a given token from its previous
owner to a new owner. The caller of this method can be the owner of the
token, but it can also be another contract, called _operator_,
as long as the latter has
been previously approved by the token owner, by using the
`approve` method. It is also possible to approve an operator for all
one's tokens (or remove such approval), through the `setApprovalForAll` method.
The `getApproved` method tells who is the operator approved for a given token
(if any) and the `isApprovedForAll` method tells if a given operator has been
approved to transfer all tokens of a given `owner`. The `view` method
yields a read-only view of the ledger, that reflects all future changes to the ledger.

The implementation `ERC721` provides standard implementations for all methods
of `IERC721View` and `IERC721`, adding metadata information about the name and the
symbol of the token and protected methods for minting and burning
new tokens. These are meant to be called in subclasses, such as
`ERC721Burnable`. Namely, the latter adds a `burn` method that allows the owner of a token
(or its approved operator) to burn the token.

As we have already said previously, the owners of the tokens are declared as contracts
in the `IERC721View` and `IERC721` interfaces, but the `ERC721` implementation
actually requires them to be `IERC71Receiver`s or externally owned accounts.
Otherwise, the methods of `ERC721` will throw an exception.
Moreover, token owners that implement the `IERC721Receiver` interface
get their `onReceive` method called whenever new tokens are transferred to them.

> The ERC721 standard requires `onReceive` to return a special message, in order
> to prove that the contract actually executed that method. This is a very technical
> necessity of Solidity, whose first versions allowed one to call non-existent methods
> without getting an error. It is a sort of security measure, since Solidity

> The implementation in Solidity uses the ERC165 standard for interface detection,
> but that standard is not a reliable replacement of `instanceof`,

> Takamaka is Java and can use the `instanceof` operator, that works correctly.
> As a consequence, the `onReceive` method in Takamaka needn't return any value.

### Implementing Our Own ERC721 Token

__[See project `erc721` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

Let us define a ledger for non-fungible tokens
that only allows its creator the mint or burn tokens.
We will call it `CryptoShark`. As Figure @fig:erc721_hierarchy shows,
we plug it below the `ERC721` implementation, so that we inherit that implementation
and do not need to reimplement the methods of the `ERC721` interface.
The code is almost identical to that for the `CryptoBuddy` token defined
in [Implementing Our Own ERC20 Token](#implementing-our-own-erc20-token).

Create in Eclipse a new Maven Java 11 (or later) project named `erc721`.
You can do this by duplicating the project `erc20` (make sure to store
the project inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` directory, as a sibling of `family`, `ponzi`, `tictactoe`
and so on). Use the following `pom.xml`:

```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0

          </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>

</project>
```

and the following `module-info.java`:

```java
module erc721 {
  requires io.takamaka.code;
}
```

Create package `io.takamaka.erc721` inside `src/main/java` and add
the following `CryptoShark.java` inside that package:

```java
package io.takamaka.erc721;

import static io.takamaka.code.lang.Takamaka.require;

import java.math.BigInteger;

import io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.FromContract;
import io.takamaka.code.tokens.ERC721;

public class CryptoShark extends ERC721 {
  private final Contract owner;

  public @FromContract CryptoShark() {
    super("CryptoShark", "SHK");
    owner = caller();
  }

  public @FromContract void mint(Contract account, BigInteger tokenId) {
    require(caller() == owner, "Lack of permission");
    _mint(account, tokenId);
  }

  public @FromContract void burn(BigInteger tokenId) {
    require(caller() == owner, "Lack of permission");
    _burn(tokenId);
  }
}
```

The constructor of `CryptoShark` takes note of the creator of the token.
That creator is the only that is allowed to mint or burn tokens, as
you can see in methods `mint` and `burn`.

You can generate the `erc721-0.0.1.jar` file:

```shell
$ cd erc721
$ mvn package
```

Then you can install that jar in the node and create an instance of the token
exactly as we did for the `CryptoBuddy` ERC20 token before.

# Hotmoka Nodes

A Hotmoka node is a device that implements an interface for running Java code
remotely. It can be any kind of device, such as a device of an IoT network,
but also a node of a blockchain. We have already used instances of Hotmoka nodes,
namely, instances of `RemoteNode`. But there are other examples of nodes, that we
will describe in this chapter.

The interface `io.hotmoka.nodes.Node` is shown in the topmost part of Figure @fig:node_hierarchy.
That interface can be split in five parts:

1. A `get` part, that includes methods for querying the
   state of the node and for accessing the objects contained in its store.
2. An `add` part, that expands the store of the node with the result of a transaction.
3. A `run` part, that allows one to run transactions that execute `@View` methods and hence do not
   expand the store of the node.
4. A `post` part, that expands the store of the node with the result of a transaction,
   without waiting for its result; instead, a future is returned.
5. A `subscribe` part, that allows users to subscribe listeners of events generated during
   the execution of the transactions.

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="800" src="pics/nodes.png" alt="Figure @fig:node_hierarchy. The hierarchy of Hotmoka nodes"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:node_hierarchy. The hierarchy of Hotmoka nodes.</p>

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:node_hierarchy. The hierarchy of Hotmoka nodes.](pics/nodes.png "Figure @fig:node_hierarchy. The hierarchy of Hotmoka nodes."){ width=100% }

If a node belongs to a blockchain, then all nodes of the blockchain have the same vision
of the state, so that it is equivalent to call a method of a node or of any other node of the
network. The only method that is out of consensus, since it contains information specific
to each node, is `getNodeInfo`. It reports for instance the type of the node and its version.

Looking at Figure @fig:node_hierarchy, it is possible to see that
the `Node` interface has many implementations, that we describe below.

#### Local Implementations

*Local Implementations* are actual nodes that run on the machine
where they have been started. For instance, they can be a node
of a larger blockchain network. Among them,
`TendermintBlockchain` implements a node of a Tendermint blockchain
and will be presented in [Tendermint Homoka Nodes](#tendermint-hotmoka-nodes).
`MemoryBlockchain` implements a single-node blockchain in RAM,
hence its content is partially lost after it is turned off.
It is useful for debugging, testing and learning, since it allows
one to inspect the content of blocks, transactions and store.
It will be presented in [Memory Nodes](#memory-nodes).
`TakamakaBlockchain` implements a node for the Takamaka blockchain
developed by Ailia SA. Local nodes
can be instantiated through the static
factory method `init()` of their implementing interface. That method requires to specify
parameters that are global to the network of nodes (`ConsensusParams`) and must be the same
for all nodes in the network, and parameters that are specific to the given node
of the network that is being started
and can be different from node to node (`TendermintBlockchainConfig` and similar).
Some implementations have to ability to _resume_.
This means that they recover the state at the end of a previous execution, reconstruct the
consensus parameters from that state and resume the execution from there, downloading
and verifying blocks already processed by the network. In order to resume
a node from an already existing state, the static `resume()` method of its implementing interface
must be used.

#### Decorators

The `Node` interface is implemented by some decorators as well.
Typically, these decorators run some transactions on the decorated node,
to simplify some tasks, such as the initialization of a node, the installation of jars into a node
or the creation of accounts in a node. These decorators are views of the decorated node, in the sense
that any method of the `Node` interface, invoked on the decorator, is forwarded
to the decorated node. We will discuss them in
[Node Decorators](#node-decorators).

#### Adaptors

Very often, one wants to _publish_ a node online,
so that we (and other programmers who need its service) can use it concurrently.
This should be possible for all implementations of the `Node` interface,
such as `MemoryBlockchain`, `TendermintBlockchain` and all present and future implementations.
In other words, we would like to publish _any_
Hotmoka node as a service, accessible through the internet. This will be the subject
of [Hotmoka Services](#hotmoka-services).
Conversely, once a Hotmoka node has been published at some URL, say
`http://my.company.com`, it will be accessible through some network API, through the
SOAP or REST protocol, and also through websockets, for subscription to events. This complexity
might make it awkward, for a programmer, to use the published node.
In that case, we can create an instance of `Node` that operates as
a proxy to the network service, helping programmers integrate
their software to the service in a seamless way. This _remote_ node still implements
the `Node` interface, but simply forwards all its calls to the remote service.
By programming against
the same `Node` interface, it becomes easy for a programmer
to swap a local node with a remote node, or
vice versa. This mechanism is described in
[Remote Nodes](#remote-nodes),
where the adaptor interface `RemoteNode` in Figure @fig:node_hierarchy is presented.

## Tendermint Hotmoka Nodes

Tendermint [[Tendermint]](#references) is a
Byzantine-fault tolerant engine for building blockchains, that
replicates a finite-state machine on a network of nodes across the world.
The finite-state machine is often referred to as a *Tendermint app*.
The nice feature of Tendermint is that it takes care of all
issues related to networking and consensus, leaving to the
developer only the task to develop the Tendermint app.

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="700" src="pics/hotmoka_tendermint.png" alt="Figure @fig:hotmoka_tendermint. The architecture of the Hotmoka node based on Tendermint"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:hotmoka_tendermint. The architecture of the Hotmoka node based on Tendermint.</p>

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:hotmoka_tendermint. The architecture of the Hotmoka node based on Tendermint.](pics/hotmoka_tendermint.png "Figure @fig:hotmoka_tendermint. The architecture of the Hotmoka node based on Tendermint."){ width=80% }

There is a Hotmoka node that implements such a Tendermint app,
for programming in Takamaka over Tendermint. We have already used that node
in the previous chapter, since that installed at
`panarea.hotmoka.io` is one of such nodes.
Figure @fig:hotmoka_tendermint
shows the architecture of a Tendermint Hotmoka node.
It consists of a few components.
The Hotmoka component is the Tendermint app that
implements the transactions on the state, resulting from the installation
of jars and the execution of code written in the Takamaka subset of Java. This part is the same in every
implementation of a Hotmoka node, not only for this one based on Tendermint.
In most cases, as here, the database that contains the state is implemented by
using the Xodus transactional database by IntelliJ.
What is specific here, however, is that transactions are put inside a blockchain
implemented by Tendermint. The communication occurs, internally, through the two TCP ports
26657 and 26658, that are the standard choice of Tendermint for communicating with an app.
Clients can contact the Hotmoka node
through any port, typically but not exclusively 80 or 8080,
as a service that implements the interface `Node` in Figure @fig:node_hierarchy.
The node can live alone but is normally integrated with other Hotmoka nodes based on Tendermint, so that
they execute and verify the same transactions, reaching the same state at the end. This happens through
the TCP port 26656, that allows Tendermint instances to _gossip_: they exchange transactions and information on peers
and finally reach consensus.
Each node can be configured to use a different port to communicate with clients,
which is useful if, for instance, ports 80 or 8080 (or both)
are already used by some other service.
Port 26656 must be the same for all nodes in the network, since they must communicate on
a standard port.

### Starting a Tendermint Hotmoka Node Manually

We can use `panarea.hotmoka.io` to play with
accounts and Takamaka contracts. However, we might want to
install our own node, part of the same blockchain network of `panarea.hotmoka.io`
or part of a brand new blockchain. In the former case, our own node will execute
the transactions, exactly as `panarea.hotmoka.io`, so that we can be sure that they are
executed according to the rules. In the latter case, we can have our own blockchain that
executes our transactions only, instead of using a shared blockchain such as that
at `panarea.hotmoka.io`.

This section shows how you can start your own Hotmoka Tendermint node,
consisting of a single validator node, hence part of its own blockchain.
The process is not difficult but is a bit tedious,
because it requires one to install Tendermint and to create
its configuration files. Section [Starting a Tendermint Node with Docker](#starting-a-tendermint-hotmoka-node-with-docker)
provides a simpler alternative for reaching the same goal, by using the Docker tool.

> We strongly suggest you to use Docker to install Hotmoka nodes, instead of the instructions
> in this section, hence please
> follow the instructions in [Starting a Tendermint Node with Docker](#starting-a-tendermint-hotmoka-node-with-docker).
> The current section only exists in order to understand what happens inside the Docker container.
> If you are not a developer, or if you are not interested in the topic, please skip this section and

In order to use a Tendermint Hotmoka node, the Tendermint executable must be
installed in our machine, or our experiments will fail. The Hotmoka node
works with Tendermint version @tendermint_version, that can be downloaded in executable
form from [https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/releases/tag/v@tendermint_version](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/releases/tag/v@tendermint_version).
Be sure that you download the executable for the architecture of your computer
and install it at a place that is
part of the command-line path of your computer. This means that,
if you run the following command in a shell:

```shell
$ tendermint version
```

the answer must be

```
@tendermint_version
```

or similar, as long as the version starts with @tendermint_version. Our Hotmoka node built on Tendermint is known
to work on Windows, MacOs and Linux machines.

Before starting a local node of a Hotmoka blockchain based on Tendermint, you
need to create the Tendermint configuration file. For instance, in order
to run a single validator node with no non-validator nodes, you can create
its configuration files as follows:

```shell
$ tendermint testnet --v 1 --n 0
```

This will create a directory `mytestnet/node0`
for a single Tendermint node, that includes the configuration
of the node and its private and public validator keys.

Once this is done, you can create a key pair for the gamete
of the node that you are going to start. You perform this with `moka`:

```shell
$ moka create-key

Please specify the password of the new key: king
A new key FaHYC1TxCJBcpgz8FrXy2bidwNBgPjPg1L7GEHaDHwmZ has been created.
Its entropy has been saved into the file
  "./FaHYC1TxCJBcpgz8FrXy2bidwNBgPjPg1L7GEHaDHwmZ.pem".
```

The entropy is a representation of the key pair. The name of the file
is the Base58-encoded public key of the pair. While the entropy and the password are secret information
that you should not distribute, the public key can be used to create a new node.
Namely, you can start a Hotmoka node based on Tendermint,
that uses the Tendermint configuration
directory that you have just created,
by using the `moka init-tendermint` command. You also need
to specify how much coins are minted for the gamete
and where is the jar of the runtime of Takamaka, that will
be stored inside the node as `takamakaCode`: we use the
local Maven's cache for that:

```shell
$ moka init-tendermint 100000000000000
    --tendermint-config mytestnet/node0
    --takamaka-code ~/.m2/repository/io/hotmoka/io-takamaka-code/
                         @hotmoka_version/io-takamaka-code-@hotmoka_version.jar
    --key-of-gamete FaHYC1TxCJBcpgz8FrXy2bidwNBgPjPg1L7GEHaDHwmZ

Do you really want to start a new node at this place
  (old blocks and store will be lost) [Y/N] Y

The following node has been initialized:
  takamakaCode: b23118aa95fa436f951bdc78d5ffea99a7bd72cf1512bef3df2ea12993f18a70
  manifest: 21d375ae9bac3b74d1a54a6418f7c70c2c107665fb2066a94dbf65cb3db9cdc6#0
    chainId: chain-btmZzq
    ...
    signature: ed25519
    gamete: d2fc1b34d6e4b2d2d80f7665d5ef4d5eb81e927cebe2240aec4dda7c1173542b#0
      balance: 100000000000000
      maxFaucet: 0
      ...
    ...

The Hotmoka node has been published at localhost:8080
Try for instance in a browser: http://localhost:8080/get/manifest

The owner of the key of the gamete can bind it to its address now:
  moka bind-key FaHYC1TxCJBcpgz8FrXy2bidwNBgPjPg1L7GEHaDHwmZ
    --url url_of_this_node
or
  moka bind-key FaHYC1TxCJBcpgz8FrXy2bidwNBgPjPg1L7GEHaDHwmZ
    --reference d2fc1b34d6e4b2d2d80f7665d5ef4d5eb81e927cebe2240aec4dda7c1173542b#0

Press enter to exit this program and turn off the node
```

This command has done a lot! It has created an instance
of `TendermintBlockchain`; it has stored the `io-takamaka-code` jar
inside it, at a reference called `takamakaCode`; it has created
a Java object, called manifest, that contains other objects, including
an externally-owned account named `gamete`, whose public key is
that provided after `--key-of-gamete`;
it has initialized the balance of the gamete to
the value passed after `moka init-tendermint`. Finally, this command
has published an internet service at localhost, that exports the API
of the node. For instance, you can open the suggested URL

```url
http://localhost:8080/get/manifest
```
in a browser, to see the JSON answer:

```json
{"transaction":{"type":"local",
    "hash":"21d375ae9bac3b74d1a54a6418f7c70c2c107665fb2066a94dbf65cb3db9cdc6"},
  "progressive":"0"}
```

> By default, `init-tendermint` publishes the service at port 8080. This can be changed
> with its `--port` switch.

> The chain identifier of the blockchain is specified inside the Tendermint configuration
> files. You can edit such files and set your preferred chain identifier before invoking
> `init-tendermint`.

You can also try

```url
http://localhost:8080/get/nameOfSignatureAlgorithmForRequests
```

and see the following response in your browser:

```json
{"algorithm":"ed25519"}
```

In order to use the gamete, you should bind its key to its actual storage
reference in the node, on your local machine. Open another shell,
move inside the directory holding the keys of the gamete and digit:

```shell
$ moka bind-key FaHYC1TxCJBcpgz8FrXy2bidwNBgPjPg1L7GEHaDHwmZ

A new account d2fc1b34d6e4b2d2d80f7665d5ef4d5eb81e927cebe2240aec4dda7c1173542b#0
  has been created.
Its entropy has been saved into the file
  "./d2fc1b34d6e4b2d2d80f7665d5ef4d5eb81e927cebe2240aec4dda7c1173542b#0.pem".
```

This operation has created a pem file whose name is that of the storage reference of the gamete.
With this file, it is possible to run transactions on behalf of the gamete.

Your computer exports a Hotmoka node now, running on Tendermint.
If your computer is reachable at some address `my.machine`, anybody can contact
your node at `http://my.machine:8080`, query your node and run transactions on your node.
However, what has been created is a Tendermint node where all initial coins are inside
the gamete. By using the gamete, _you_ can fill the node with objects
and accounts now, and in general run all transactions you want.
However, other users, who do not know the keys of the gamete,
will not be able to run any non-`@View` transaction on your node.
If you want to open a faucet, so that other users can gain droplets of coins,
you must add the `--open-unsigned-faucet` option to the `moka init-tendermint`
command above. Then, _in another shell_ (since the previous one is busy with the
execution of the node), in a directory holding the keys of the gamete,
you can type:

```shell
$ moka faucet 5000000

Please specify the password of the gamete account: king
```

which specifies the maximal amount of coins that
the faucet is willing to give away at each request (its _flow_). You can re-run the `moka faucet`
command many times, in order to change the flow of the faucet, or close it completely.
Needless to say, only the owner of the keys of the gamete can run the `moka faucet` command,
which is why the file with the entropy
of the gamete must be in the directory where you run `moka faucet`.

After opening a faucet with a sufficient flow, anybody can
re-run the examples of the previous chapters by replacing
`@server` with `my.machine:8080`: your computer will serve
the requests and run the transactions.

If you turn off your Hotmoka node based on Tendermint, its state remains saved inside the
`chain` directory: the `chain/blocks` subdirectory is where Tendermint stores the blocks
of the chain; while `chain/store` contains the Xodus database,
consisting of the storage objects created in blockchain.
Later, you can resume the node from that state, by typing:

```shell
$ moka resume-tendermint --tendermint-config mytestnet/node0
...
Press enter to exit this program and turn off the node
```

There is a log file that can be useful to check the state of our Hotmoka-Tendermint app.
Namely, `tendermint.log` contains the log of Tendermint itself. It can be interesting
to inspect which blocks are committed and when:

```
I[2021-05-05|11:46:00.113] Version info, software=@tendermint_version block=10 p2p=7
I[2021-05-05|11:46:00.248] Starting Node, impl=Node

I[2021-05-05|11:46:15.568] Committed state, height=9 txs=3 appHash=4876BD...
...
```
Note how the block height increases and that the application hash changes whenever a block
contains transactions (`validTxs`>0), reflecting the fact that the state has been modified.

### Starting a Tendermint Hotmoka Node with Docker

The methodology in the previous section is relatively complex. Moreover, it is
fragile, since the node might have a slightly different behavior, depending on the
exact configuration of the machine and of the exact version of the Java runtime installed
in the machine. There is a simpler and less fragile
way of installing a Tendermint Hotmoka node, by using the Docker tool.
We cannot discuss Docker here. We just say that it is a utility to run lightweight
containers in a machine. The container is a sort of preconfigured
sandbox, whose configuration is fixed
and already provided at installation time. Therefore, there is nothing to install if we use
a Docker container to start the node, not even a Java runtime. Everything is already
prepared inside the container. Well, our machine must have Docker installed, but that is the
only requirement.

We have provided some preconfigured Docker images in Docker Hub, that you can see
at [https://hub.docker.com/u/hotmoka](https://hub.docker.com/u/hotmoka). By using one of such
images, we can start our own Tendermint Hotmoka node as follow. First, we need to create the
key pair of the gamete, as we did in the previous section:

```shell
$ moka create-key

Please specify the password of the new key: king
A new key EETeUZTC2HZkRyPoLugEgzfTtA88qYpprgbUnmExSPfe has been created.
Its entropy has been saved into the file
  "./EETeUZTC2HZkRyPoLugEgzfTtA88qYpprgbUnmExSPfe.pem".
```

We can now start a Docker node as a container:

```shell
$ docker run -dit
    -e INITIAL_SUPPLY=1000000000000000
    -e KEY_OF_GAMETE=EETeUZTC2HZkRyPoLugEgzfTtA88qYpprgbUnmExSPfe
    -e CHAIN_ID=caterpillar
    -e OPEN_UNSIGNED_FAUCET=true
    -p 8080:8080
    -p 26656:26656
    -v chain:/home/hotmoka/chain
    hotmoka/tendermint-node:@hotmoka_version
    init

4c077bb6cd7094208d6a05f0ca6b5883c5273f3267b2bf8e5676a9cfb92d392e
```

Wait for a few seconds, in order to give time to the node to start. The node should be up
and running in your local machine, as you can verify with `moka info`:

```shell
$ moka info --url localhost:8080

Info about the node:
  takamakaCode: c2003c1109c33acaa3d8e081327f35f5cb960e4e8ee6743674087b00cb7bbeb9
  manifest: 7c7cc7c0a0435127fea73a6a5087486205bf259e577852bfbf333fb789aa8af1#0
    chainId: caterpillar
    gamete: ec8581085fc7e7977aa15f44928ee66315a873762342f09e585e521dd8474a05#0
      balance: 1000000000000000
    ...
```

In order to use the gamete, we must bind the key to its storage reference:

```shell
$ moka bind-key EETeUZTC2HZkRyPoLugEgzfTtA88qYpprgbUnmExSPfe

A new account ec8581085fc7e7977aa15f44928ee66315a873762342f09e585e521dd8474a05#0
  has been created.
Its entropy has been saved into the file
  "./ec8581085fc7e7977aa15f44928ee66315a873762342f09e585e521dd8474a05#0.pem".
```

That's all. We can now use the gamete to open the faucet of the node (`moka faucet`) and play
with the node as we did in the previous chapters of this book. Just direct the clients
to `localhost:8080` instead of `panarea.hotmoka.io`.

Let us analyze the options passed to `docker`. The `run -dit` command means that we want to
instantiate, and run as an interactive daemon,
a Docker image, which is actually specified at the end:
`hotmoka/tendermint-node:@hotmoka_version`. Docker will download that image from Docker Hub.

> That image assumes that you are using a Linux machine based on the amd64 architecture.
> If you are using a Linux machine based on the arm64 architecture, use the
> `hotmoka/tendermint-node-arm64:@hotmoka_version` image. If you are using a Windows machine,
> you need to run a Linux image inside a Linux virtual machine, as always in Docker.

A specific command of the image is run, specified at the end: it is the `init` command
that initializes a Tendermint Hotmoka node.
Options of `run` are passed to the Docker image as environment variables,
through the `-e` switch. The `INITIAL_SUPPLY` is the amount of coins
provided to the gamete initially, that is, the amount of cryptocurrency available
initially in the blockchain. The `KEY_OF_GAMETE` is
what we have generated with `moka create-key` and will be put inside the gamete as its public key.
The `CHAIN_ID` is the chain identifier of the blockchain started by the node.
The `OPEN_UNSIGNED_FAUCET` switch opens a free faucet for getting cryptocurrency for free from the
gamete: use `false` for that in a real blockchain.

As shown in Figure @fig:hotmoka_tendermint, a Tendermint Hotmoka node communicates
to the external world through ports 26656 for gossip and 8080 (or 80 or any other port) for clients.
Hence those ports must be connected to the Docker image. We do that with the
`-p` switch. Specifically, port 8080 of the real machine is bound to port 8080 of the Docker image
and port 26656 of the real machine is bound to port 26656 of the Docker image. If we prefer to use
port 80 for clients, we should use `-p 80:8080` instead of `-p 8080:8080`.

Finally, the blocks and state created by the node are saved into a `/home/hotmoka/chain`
directory inside the container that is implemented as a Docker volume `chain`. That
volume is visible in the real machine as `/var/lib/docker/volumes/chain/_data/` and will be
persisted if we turn the Docker container off.

> The actual directory that contains the volume depends on the specific version of Docker.
> Currently, it is  `/var/lib/docker/volumes/chain/_data/` in Linux machines and you must be
> root to access it.

The `docker run` command printed a hash at the end, that identifies the running container.
We can use it, for instance, to turn the container off when we do not need it anymore:

```shell
$ docker stop 4c077bb6cd7094208d6a05f0ca6b5883c5273f3267b2bf8e5676a9cfb92d392e
```

> The hash will be different in your experiments. Use yours.

You can verify that the Tendermint Hotmoka node is not available anymore:

```shell
$ moka info --url localhost:8080

Failed to connect to 'localhost:8080': Connection refused
```

However, the data of the blockchain still exists, inside its directory of the
real machine:
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/chain/_data/`. Hence, it is possible to resume the execution of the
blockchain from its final state. Restrain from using again
the `docker run` command
for that: it would create a brand new blockchain, from scratch, destroying the local data
of the previous blockchain.
Similarly if you use the `docker start` command. Unless this is actually what you want to achieve,
the right command to resume a blockchain from its saved state is

```shell
$ docker run -dit
    -p 8080:8080
    -p 26656:26656
    -v chain:/home/hotmoka/chain
    hotmoka/tendermint-node:1.0.7
    resume

54a465e5ef7cd30d01d30d879aaa83a86d1851ea26461fad26352a2453146405
```

Wait for a few seconds and then verify that the _same_ node is back:

```shell
$ moka info --url localhost:8080

Info about the node:
  takamakaCode: c2003c1109c33acaa3d8e081327f35f5cb960e4e8ee6743674087b00cb7bbeb9
  manifest: 7c7cc7c0a0435127fea73a6a5087486205bf259e577852bfbf333fb789aa8af1#0
    chainId: caterpillar
    gamete: ec8581085fc7e7977aa15f44928ee66315a873762342f09e585e521dd8474a05#0
      balance: 1000000000000000
    ...
```

Turn the node off now and conclude our experiment:

```shell
$ docker stop 54a465e5ef7cd30d01d30d879aaa83a86d1851ea26461fad26352a2453146405
```

The Docker image contains a `help` command. Try for instance:

```shell
$ docker run --rm -it hotmoka/tendermint-node:@hotmoka_version help

This container runs a Hotmoka node based on Tendermint.
It understands the following commands and options:

  help:   prints this help
  init:   creates a node for a brand new blockchain
    CHAIN_ID: the chain identifier of the new blockchain
      [default: the string "missing"]
    KEY_OF_GAMETE: the Base58-encoded ed25519 public key of the gamete
      [required, no default]
    ...
  start:  creates a node that connects to an already existing node of a blockchain
    NETWORK_URL: the URL of the already existing node
    ...
  resume: resumes a node that was previously turned off with "docker stop"
    ...
```

We have already discussed the `help`, `init` and `resume` commands. Next section will show an example
of use of the `start` command.

### Publishing a Tendermint Hotmoka Node on Amazon EC2

In the previous two sections,
we have published a Hotmoka node on our machine (the localhost).
This might not be the best place where
the node should be published, since our machine might not allow external internet connections
and since we might want to turn the machine off after we stop working with it.
In reality, a node should be published inside a machine that can receive external connections and
that is always on, at least for a long period. There are many solutions for that.
Here, we describe the simple technique of using a rented machine from Amazon AWS
EC2's computing cloud [[EC2]](#references).
This service offers a micro machine for free, while more powerful machines
require one to pay for their use. Since the micro machine is enough for our purposes,
EC2 is a good candidate for experimentation. Nevertheless, what we describe in this section
can be achieved with any other cloud rental architecture.

Conceptually, there is nothing special with running a Tendermint Hotmoka node
inside an Amazon EC2 machine. Just start a free microservice machine and ssh to it
in order to install Docker, by following the standard installation instructions for Docker
in a Linux machine, that you can find at
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
As Figure @fig:hotmoka_tendermint shows, ports 80 (for instance) and 26656 must be open
in order for a Tendermint Hotmoka node to work correctly. Therefore, use a browser to access
the Amazon EC2 console, select your micromachine and inspect its security group. Modify its
inbound rules so that they allow connections to ports 22 (for ssh), 26656 (for gossip)
and 80 (for clients). At the end, such rules should look as in Figure @fig:inbound_rules.

[Markdownonly]: <p align="center"><img width="800" src="pics/inbound_rules.png" alt="Figure @fig:inbound_rules. The inbound rules for the Amazon EC2 machine"></p><p align="center">Figure @fig:inbound_rules. The inbound rules for the Amazon EC2 machine.</p>

[PDFonly]: ![Figure @fig:inbound_rules. The inbound rules for the Amazon EC2 machine.](pics/inbound_rules.png "Figure @fig:inbound_rules. The inbound rules for the Amazon EC2 machine."){ width=100% }

Create the key of the gamete in your local machine:

```shell
$ moka create-key

Please specify the password of the new key: king
A new key 9PhEVACUFjTEXwoMETzXwsjSTVe2c9dJMuUymxGTo4vF has been created.
Its entropy has been saved into the file
  "./9PhEVACUFjTEXwoMETzXwsjSTVe2c9dJMuUymxGTo4vF.pem".
```

and use it to start a node in the EC2 machine:

```shell
ec2$ docker run -dit
       -e INITIAL_SUPPLY=1234567890
       -e KEY_OF_GAMETE=9PhEVACUFjTEXwoMETzXwsjSTVe2c9dJMuUymxGTo4vF
       -e CHAIN_ID=caterpillar
       -p 80:8080
       -p 26656:26656
       -v chain:/home/hotmoka/chain
       hotmoka/tendermint-node:1.0.7
       init

5f3799b58c6569b50dbebee6db3061ebf8e3c2c7ac6e0882579129ca66302786
```

> The command above is given inside the EC2 machine, hence the `ec2$` prompt.

Wait for a few seconds and then verify, in your local machine, that the remote node is available:

```shell
$ moka info --url ec2-34-244-119-200.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com

Info about the node:
  takamakaCode: c2003c1109c33acaa3d8e081327f35f5cb960e4e8ee6743674087b00cb7bbeb9
  manifest: e6f36a564872b8a032881f38325d85202d1b7853327ddf9a7281a1342a9d8034#0
    chainId: caterpillar
    gamete: ce1b85355a9237ed701f4ca9c498e77c1f0876535b0dc7716cdd15a72c19a407#0
      balance: 1234567890
  ...
```

> The URL of your micromachine can be found in the Amazon EC2 console.
> We have used ours above, while you should use yours of course.
> Remember that 80 is the default port in URLs.

You can bind the key of the gamete in your local machine now:

```shell
$ moka bind-key 9PhEVACUFjTEXwoMETzXwsjSTVe2c9dJMuUymxGTo4vF
    --url ec2-34-244-119-200.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com

A new account ce1b85355a9237ed701f4ca9c498e77c1f0876535b0dc7716cdd15a72c19a407#0
  has been created.
Its entropy has been saved into the file
  "./ce1b85355a9237ed701f4ca9c498e77c1f0876535b0dc7716cdd15a72c19a407#0.pem".
```

When you do not need the node anymore, turn it off in the remote machine:

```shell
ec2$ docker stop 5f3799b58c6569b50dbebee6db3061ebf8e3c2c7ac6e0882579129ca66302786
```

We have started, and subsequently turned off, a blockchain consisting of a single validator
node, living in splendid isolation. But we might want to do something different.
Namely, we want now to start a node that _belongs_ to the same blockchain network as
`panarea.hotmoka.io`. This means that the node will be started and will replay
all transactions already executed by `panarea.hotmoka.io`, starting from the empty state.
At the end, our node will be a clone of `panarea.hotmoka.io`, with its same state.
From that moment on, our node can be used to replay and follow the new transactions that
reach the blockchain of `panarea.hotmoka.io`, and also to send new transactions to that
blockchain. It will be a _peer_ of that blockchain network. Note, however, that it will
not be a validator.

In order to achieve that result, we can use the `start` command of the Docker image,
in the remore EC2 machine:

```shell
ec2$ docker run -dit
       -e NETWORK_URL=panarea.hotmoka.io
       -p 80:8080
       -p 26656:26656
       -v chain:/home/hotmoka/chain
       hotmoka/tendermint-node:1.0.7
       start

3335d7609ecbd3d6ad42577aee0d0a2fd1bc59ed3c18ae7da2d77febbd776a84
```

The `start` command needs only an option, the `NETWORK_URL` switch, that
specifies the URL of a node to clone and become a peer of. If you wait for a few seconds,
you can see that a new node has been published, that is part of the blockchain network
of `panarea.hotmoka.io`:

```shell
$ moka info --url ec2-34-244-119-200.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com

Info about the node:
  takamakaCode: @takamakaCode
  manifest: @manifest
    chainId: @chainid
    maxErrorLength: 300
    signature: ed25519
    ...
    gamete: @gamete
      balance: 99999999999999999999...
      maxFaucet: @maxFaucet
```
Note that the information of this node is that of `panarea.hotmoka.io`
(compare it with that
in section [Contacting a Hotmoka Test Node](#contacting-a-hotmoka-test-node)).
That is, the started node is a clone of `panarea.hotmoka.io` and can be used at its place.

In general, the `start` command might take a while, since it downloads and replays all transactions
already executed in the cloned node. Therefore, if you turn the started node off with the `docker stop` command,
as done before, and then want it on again, it is not convenient to start the clone again, since
it will download and replay the transactions again, from scratch. Instead, use the `resume` command with
`docker run`, as we have already done before. This makes the node resume from its old state, so that
it will only download and replay the transactions that have been done in the remote node since
the stop of the clone.

You can see the logs of your container with the standard technique of Docker. Namely,
in the EC2 machine you can run:

```shell
ec2$ docker logs 3335d7609ecbd3d6ad42577aee0d0a2fd1bc59ed3c18ae7da2d77febbd776a84
```

which will print all logs of the container. If you want to see the logs in real time,
while they are generated by the container, you can run

```shell
ec2$ docker logs -f 3335d7609ecbd3d6ad42577aee0d0a2fd1bc59ed3c18ae7da2d77febbd776a84
```

Remember that Docker places the logs in a JSON file accessible in the container directory of the
EC2 machine (you must be root to see that directory):

```shell
ec2$ sudo ls /var/lib/docker/containers
              /3335d7609ecbd3d6ad42577aee0d0a2fd1bc59ed3c18ae7da2d77febbd776a84

3335d7609ecbd3d6ad42577aee0d0a2fd1bc59ed3c18ae7da2d77febbd776a84-json.log
...
```

> If you do not `docker stop` your container but log out from the EC2 machine, the container will
> continue to run in the background, as always with Docker, and can be contacted from
> external clients. Of course, if you turn the EC2 machine
> off from the EC2 management console of Amazon, the node will die and will become unreachable.

## Memory Nodes

The Tendermint Hotmoka nodes of the previous sections form a real blockchain.
They are perfect for deploying a blockchain where we can program smart contracts in
Takamaka. Nevertheless, they are slow for debugging: transactions are committed every few seconds,
by default. Hence, if we want to see the result of a transaction,
we have to wait for some seconds at least.
Moreover, Tendermint does not allow one to see the effects of each single transaction,
in a simple way. For testing, debugging and didactical purposes, it would be simpler to have a light node
that behaves like a blockchain, allows access to blocks and transactions as text files,
but is not a blockchain. This is the goal of the `MemoryBlockchain` nodes.
They are not part of an actual blockchain since they do not duplicate transactions
in a peer-to-peer network, where
consensus is imposed. But they are very
handy because they allow one to inspect, very easily, the requests sent to
the node and the corresponding responses.

You can start a memory Hotmoka node, with an open faucet, exactly as you did,
in the previous section, for a Tendermint node, but using the `moka init-memory`
command instead of `moka init-tendermint`. You do not need any Tendermint configuration
this time, but still need a key to control the gamete of the node, that you can create
exactly as for a Tendermint Hotmoka node:

```shell
$ moka create-key

Please specify the password of the new key: king
A new key FaHYC1TxCJBcpgz8FrXy2bidwNBgPjPg1L7GEHaDHwmZ has been created.
Its entropy has been saved into the file
  "./FaHYC1TxCJBcpgz8FrXy2bidwNBgPjPg1L7GEHaDHwmZ.pem".
```

You specify the public component of the key when starting the node:

```shell
$ moka init-memory 100000000000000000000000
    --open-unsigned-faucet
    --takamaka-code ~/.m2/repository/io/hotmoka/io-takamaka-code/
                         @hotmoka_version/io-takamaka-code-@hotmoka_version.jar
    --key-of-gamete FaHYC1TxCJBcpgz8FrXy2bidwNBgPjPg1L7GEHaDHwmZ

Do you really want to start a new node at this place
  (old blocks and store will be lost) [Y/N] Y

The following node has been initialized:
  takamakaCode: b23118aa95fa436f951bdc78d5ffea99a7bd72cf1512bef3df2ea12993f18a70
  manifest: ff7855ed728c2f323341d493a6a7b33218e4844b512c3dd86220e05fd0af7847#0
    ...
    gamete: ee7a549a9419f6178efea6291121535efd71aa6c98233c89a4a0fae700a6efcc#0
    ...

The Hotmoka node has been published at localhost:8080
Try for instance in a browser: http://localhost:8080/get/manifest

The owner of the key of the gamete can bind it to its address now:
  moka bind-key FaHYC1TxCJBcpgz8FrXy2bidwNBgPjPg1L7GEHaDHwmZ --url url_of_this_node
or
  moka bind-key FaHYC1TxCJBcpgz8FrXy2bidwNBgPjPg1L7GEHaDHwmZ
    --reference ee7a549a9419f6178efea6291121535efd71aa6c98233c89a4a0fae700a6efcc#0

Press enter to exit this program and turn off the node
```

Then, in another shell, move in the directory holding the keys of the gamete, bind the
gamete to the keys and open the faucet:

```shell
$ moka bind-key FaHYC1TxCJBcpgz8FrXy2bidwNBgPjPg1L7GEHaDHwmZ

A new account ee7a549a9419f6178efea6291121535efd71aa6c98233c89a4a0fae700a6efcc#0
  has been created.
Its entropy has been saved into the file
  "./ee7a549a9419f6178efea6291121535efd71aa6c98233c89a4a0fae700a6efcc#0.pem".

$ moka faucet 5000000000000000

Please specify the password of the gamete account: king
```

You won't notice any real difference with Tendermint, but for the fact that this node is faster,
its chain identifier is the empty string and it has no validators. Blocks and transactions are
inside the `chain` directory, that this time contains a nice textual representation of requests and
responses:

```shell
$ tree chain
chain
  b0

> The exact ids and the number of these transactions will be different in your computer.

There are two blocks, `b0` and `b1`, each containing up to five transactions.
Each transaction is reported with its id and the pair request/response that the node has computed
for it. They are text files, that you can open to understand what is happening inside the node.

The transactions shown above are those that have initialized the node and
opened the faucet. The last transaction inside each block is a _reward_
transaction, that distributes the earnings of the block to the (zero) validators
and increases block height and number of transactions in the manifest.

Spend some time looking at the `request.txt` and `response.txt` files.
In particular, the last transaction inside `b1` should be that triggered by your `moka faucet`
command. Open its `request.txt` file. It should read like this:

```
InstanceMethodCallTransactionRequest:
  caller: ee7a549a9419f6178efea6291121535efd71aa6c98233c89a4a0fae700a6efcc#0
  nonce: 3
  gas limit: 100000
  gas price: 100
  class path: b23118aa95fa436f951bdc78d5ffea99a7bd72cf1512bef3df2ea12993f18a70
  method: void io.takamaka.code.lang.Gamete.setMaxFaucet(BigInteger, BigInteger)
  actuals:
    5000000000000000
    0
  receiver: ee7a549a9419f6178efea6291121535efd71aa6c98233c89a4a0fae700a6efcc#0
  chainId: 
  signature: 6934f9b1b614ff1fb5cc0e84929b60a0fa4ca5f292c8946b796e3afae3e1b2d07...
```

You can clearly see that the `moka faucet` command is actually calling
the `setMaxFaucet` method of the gamete,
passing `5000000000000000` as new value for the flow of the faucet.
The caller (payer) and the receiver of the method invocation coincide, since they are both the
gamete. The signature has been generated with the keys of the gamete.

If you check the corresponding `response.txt`, you will see something like:

```
VoidMethodCallTransactionSuccessfulResponse:
  gas consumed for CPU execution: 329
  gas consumed for RAM allocation: 1196
  gas consumed for storage consumption: 9590
  updates:

    <ee7a549a9419f6178efea6291121535efd71aa6c98233c89a4a0fae700a6efcc#0|
      io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract.balance:java.math.BigInteger|
      9999999999999999999999999999999998888500>

    <ee7a549a9419f6178efea6291121535efd71aa6c98233c89a4a0fae700a6efcc#0|
      io.takamaka.code.lang.ExternallyOwnedAccount.nonce:java.math.BigInteger|
      4>

    <ee7a549a9419f6178efea6291121535efd71aa6c98233c89a4a0fae700a6efcc#0|
      io.takamaka.code.lang.Gamete.maxFaucet:java.math.BigInteger|
      5000000000000000>

  events:
```

The response states clearly the cost of the transaction. Moreover, responses
typically report a set of _updates_. These are the side-effects on the state of the node,
induced by the transaction. Each update is a triple, that specifies a change in the value
of a field of a storage object. In this case, the three updates state that the
balance of the gamete has been decreased (because it paid for the transaction);
that its nonce has been increased to four (since it ran the transaction); and that the
`maxFaucet` field of the gamete has been set to 5000000000000000.

## Logs

All Hotmoka nodes generate a `hotmoka.log` log file, that reports which transactions have been
processed and potential errors. Its content, in the case of a Tendermint node, looks like:

```

```

If you want to follow in real time what is happening inside your node,
you can run for instance:

```shell
$ tail -f hotmoka.log
```

This will hang and print the new log entries as they are generated.
Assuming that you have a local node running in your machine, try for instance in another shell

```shell
$ moka info
```

You will see in the log all new entries related to the execution of the methods to access
the information on the node printed by `moka info`.

> Hotmoka nodes started with Docker disable the generation of the log files and dump
> logs to the standard output, where they can be accessed with the `docker logs` command.
> Therefore, they do not generate a `hotmoka.log` file.

## Node Decorators

__[See project `runs` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

There are some frequent actions that can be performed on a Hotmoka node.
Typically, these actions consist in a sequence of transactions.
A few examples are:

1. The creation of an externally owned account. This requires the creation
   of its private and public keys and the instantiation of an
   `io.takamaka.code.lang.ExternallyOwnedAccount`. It is not a difficult
   procedure, but it is definitely tedious and occurs frequently.
2. The installation of a jar in a node. This requires a transaction for installing
   code in the node. It requires also to parse the jar into bytes and identify the
   number of gas units for the transaction, depending on the size of the jar.
3. The initialization of a node. Namely, local nodes start empty, that is,
   their store does not contain anything at the beginning, not even their manifest
   object. This initialization is rather technical and detail might change in future
   versions of Hotmoka. Performing this initialization by hand leads to fragile
   and error-prone code.

In all these examples, Hotmoka provides decorators, that is, implementation of the
`Node` interface built from an existing `Node` object. The decorator is just an alias
to the decorated node, but adds some functionality or performs some action on it.
Figure @fig:node_hierarchy shows that there are decorators for each of the three
situations enumerated above.

In order to understand the use of node decorators and appreciate their existence,
let us write a Java class that creates a `MemoryBlockchain` node, hence initially empty;
then it initializes the node; subsequently it installs our `family-0.0.1.jar`
file in the node and finally creates two accounts in the node. We stress the fact that
these actions
can be performed in code by using calls to the node interface (Figure @fig:node_hierarchy);
they can also be performed through the `moka` tool. Here, however, we want to perform them
in code, simplified by using node decorators.

Create the following `Decorators.java` class inside the `runs` package of the `runs` project:

```java
package runs;

import java.math.BigInteger;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.security.KeyPair;

import io.hotmoka.constants.Constants;
import io.hotmoka.crypto.Base58;
import io.hotmoka.crypto.Entropy;
import io.hotmoka.crypto.SignatureAlgorithmForTransactionRequests;
import io.hotmoka.helpers.InitializedNode;
import io.hotmoka.helpers.NodeWithAccounts;
import io.hotmoka.helpers.NodeWithJars;
import io.hotmoka.memory.MemoryBlockchain;
import io.hotmoka.memory.MemoryBlockchainConfig;
import io.hotmoka.nodes.ConsensusParams;
import io.hotmoka.nodes.Node;

public class Decorators {
  public final static BigInteger GREEN_AMOUNT = BigInteger.valueOf(1_000_000_000);
  public final static BigInteger RED_AMOUNT = BigInteger.ZERO;

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    MemoryBlockchainConfig config = new MemoryBlockchainConfig.Builder().build();
    ConsensusParams consensus = new ConsensusParams.Builder().build();

    // the path of the runtime Takamaka jar, inside Maven's cache
    Path takamakaCodePath = Paths.get
      (System.getProperty("user.home") +
      "/.m2/repository/io/hotmoka/io-takamaka-code/" + Constants.VERSION +
      "/io-takamaka-code-" + Constants.VERSION + ".jar");

    // the path of the user jar to install
    Path familyPath = Paths.get("../family/target/family-0.0.1.jar");

    // create a key pair for the gamete and compute the Base58-encoding of its public key
    var signature = SignatureAlgorithmForTransactionRequests.ed25519();
    Entropy entropy = new Entropy();
    KeyPair keys = entropy.keys("password", signature);
    var publicKeyBase58 = Base58.encode(signature.encodingOf(keys.getPublic()));

    try (Node node = MemoryBlockchain.init(config, consensus)) {
      // first view: store the io-takamaka-code jar and create manifest and gamete
      InitializedNode initialized = InitializedNode.of
        (node, consensus, publicKeyBase58, takamakaCodePath, GREEN_AMOUNT, RED_AMOUNT);

      // second view: store family-0.0.1.jar: the gamete will pay for that
      NodeWithJars nodeWithJars = NodeWithJars.of
        (node, initialized.gamete(), keys.getPrivate(), familyPath);

      // third view: create two accounts, the first with 10,000,000 units of coin
      // and the second with 20,000,000 units of coin; the gamete will pay
      NodeWithAccounts nodeWithAccounts = NodeWithAccounts.of
        (node, initialized.gamete(), keys.getPrivate(),
        BigInteger.valueOf(10_000_000), BigInteger.valueOf(20_000_000));

      System.out.println("manifest: " + node.getManifest());
      System.out.println("family-0.0.1.jar: " + nodeWithJars.jar(0));
      System.out.println("account #0: " + nodeWithAccounts.account(0) +
                         "\n  with private key " + nodeWithAccounts.privateKey(0));
      System.out.println("account #1: " + nodeWithAccounts.account(1) +
                         "\n  with private key " + nodeWithAccounts.privateKey(1));
    }
  }
}
```

Run class `Decorators` from Eclipse.
It should print something like this on the console:

```
manifest: 5f1ebc34f4aef10e2c2eeac3558aae7d4df97f676f29ba9d7e28d0d1713c5ad5#0

    public data: 46d9cbcbad683d1d21079558a20fbfb7c1feb6f9c07e33c0288d939df5...
```

You can see that the use of decorators has avoided us the burden of
programming transaction requests, explicitly, and makes our code more robust,
since future versions of Hotmoka will update the implementation of the decorators,
while their interface will remain untouched, protecting our code from modifications.

As we have already said, decorators are
views of the same node, just seen through different lenses
(Java interfaces). Hence, further transactions can be run on
`node` or `initialized` or `nodeWithJars` or `nodeWithAccounts`, with the same
effects. Moreover, it is not necessary to close all such nodes: closing `node` at
the end of the try-with-resource will actually close all of them, since they are the same node.

## Hotmoka Services

__[See project `runs` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

This section shows how we can publish a Hotmoka node online, by using Java code,
so that it becomes a
network service that can be used, concurrently, by many remote clients.
Namely, we will show how to publish a blockchain node based on Tendermint, but the code
is similar if you want to publish a memory Hotmoka node or any
other Hotmoka node.

Remember that we have already published our nodes online, by using the
`moka init-tendermint` and `moka init-memory` commands, or by starting a Docker container.
Here, however, we want to do the same operation in code.

Create a class `Publisher.java` inside package `runs` of the `runs` project,
whose code is the following:

```java
package runs;

import static java.math.BigInteger.ZERO;

import java.math.BigInteger;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.security.KeyPair;

import io.hotmoka.constants.Constants;
import io.hotmoka.crypto.Base58;
import io.hotmoka.crypto.Entropy;
import io.hotmoka.crypto.SignatureAlgorithmForTransactionRequests;
import io.hotmoka.helpers.InitializedNode;
import io.hotmoka.nodes.ConsensusParams;
import io.hotmoka.nodes.Node;
import io.hotmoka.service.NodeService;
import io.hotmoka.service.NodeServiceConfig;
import io.hotmoka.tendermint.TendermintBlockchain;
import io.hotmoka.tendermint.TendermintBlockchainConfig;

public class Publisher {
  public final static BigInteger GREEN_AMOUNT = BigInteger.valueOf(100_000_000);
  public final static BigInteger RED_AMOUNT = ZERO;

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    TendermintBlockchainConfig config = new TendermintBlockchainConfig.Builder().build();
    ConsensusParams consensus = new ConsensusParams.Builder().build();
    NodeServiceConfig serviceConfig = new NodeServiceConfig.Builder().build();
    // the path of the runtime Takamaka jar, inside Maven's cache
    Path takamakaCodePath = Paths.get
      (System.getProperty("user.home") +
      "/.m2/repository/io/hotmoka/io-takamaka-code/" + Constants.VERSION +
      "/io-takamaka-code-" + Constants.VERSION + ".jar");

    // create a key pair for the gamete and compute the Base58-encoding of its public key
    var signature = SignatureAlgorithmForTransactionRequests.ed25519();
    Entropy entropy = new Entropy();
    KeyPair keys = entropy.keys("password", signature);
    var publicKeyBase58 = Base58.encode(signature.encodingOf(keys.getPublic()));

    try (Node original = TendermintBlockchain.init(config, consensus);
         // remove the next three lines if you want to publish an uninitialized node
         //InitializedNode initialized = InitializedNode.of
         //  (original, consensus, publicKeyBase58,
         //  takamakaCodePath, GREEN_AMOUNT, RED_AMOUNT);
         NodeService service = NodeService.of(serviceConfig, original)) {

        System.out.println("\nPress ENTER to turn off the server and exit this program");
        System.in.read();
    }
  }
}
```

We have already seen that `original` is a Hotmoka node based on Tendermint.
The subsequent line makes the feat:

```java
NodeService service = NodeService.of(serviceConfig, original);
```

Variable `service` holds a Hotmoka _service_, that is, an actual network service that adapts
the `original` node to a web API that is published at localhost, at port 8080
(another port number can be selected through the `serviceConfig` object, if needed). The service
is an `AutoCloseable` object: it starts when it is created and gets shut down 
when its `close()` method is invoked, which occurs, implicitly, at the end of the
scope of the try-with-resources. Hence, this service remains online until the user
presses the ENTER key and terminates the service (and the program).

Run class `Publisher` from Eclipse.
It should run for a few seconds and then start waiting for the ENTER key. Do not press such key yet! Instead,
enter the following URL into a browser running in your machine:

```url
http://localhost:8080/get/nameOfSignatureAlgorithmForRequests
```

You should see the following response in your browser:

```json
{"algorithm":"ed25519"}
```

What we have achieved, is to call the method `getNameOfSignatureAlgorithmForRequests()` of `original`,
accessible through the network service.

Let us try to ask for the storage address of the manifest of the node. Again, insert the following
URL in a browser on your local machine:

```url
http://localhost:8080/get/manifest
```

This time, the response is negative:

```json
{"message":"no manifest set for this node",
 "exceptionClassName":"java.util.NoSuchElementException"}
```

We have called the method `getManifest()` of `original`, through the network service.
Since `original` is not initialized yet, it has no manifest and no gamete. Its store is just empty
at the moment. Hence the negative response.

Thus, let us initialize the node before publishing it, so that it is already
initialized when published. Press ENTER to terminate the service, then modify
the `Publisher.java` class by uncommenting the use of the `InitializedNode` decorator,
whose goal is to create manifest and gamete of the node
and install the basic classes of Takamaka inside the node.

> Note that we have published `original`:
>
> ```java
> NodeService service = NodeService.of(serviceConfig, original);
> ```
>
> We could have published `initialized` instead:
>
> ```java
> NodeService service = NodeService.of(serviceConfig, initialized);

If you re-run class `Publisher` and re-enter the last
URL in a browser on your local machine, the response will be positive this time:

```json
{
  "transaction":
  {
    "type":"local",
    "hash":"f9ac8849f7ee484d73fd84470652582cf93da97c379fee9ccc66bd5e2ffc9867"
  },
  "progressive":"0"
}
```
This means that the manifest is allocated, in the store of `original`, at the storage reference
`f9ac8849f7ee484d73fd84470652582cf93da97c379fee9ccc66bd5e2ffc9867#0`.

## Remote Nodes

__[See project `runs` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

We have seen how a service can be published and its methods called through
a browser. This has been easy for methods such as `getManifest()` and
`getNameOfSignatureAlgorithmForRequest()` of the interface `Node`. However, it
becomes harder if we want to call methods of `Node` that need parameters, such
as `getState()` or the many `add/post/run` methods for scheduling transactions on
the node. Parameters should be passed as JSON payload of the http connection, in a format
that is hard to remember, easy to get wrong and possibly changing in the future.
Moreover, the JSON responses must be parsed back.
In principle, this can be done by hand or through software that builds the
requests for the server and interprets its responses.
Nevertheless, it is not the suggested way to proceed.

A typical solution to this problem is to provide a software SDK, that is, a library
that takes care of serializing the requests into JSON and deserializing
the responses from JSON. Roughly speaking, this is the approach taken in Hotmoka.
More precisely, as this section will show,
we can forget about the details of the JSON serialization
and deserialization of requests and responses and only program against the `Node` interface,
by using an adaptor of a published Hotmoka service into a `Node`. This adaptor is called
a _remote_ Hotmoka node.

We have used remote nodes from the very beginning of this tutorial.
Namely, if you go back to [Installation of the Jar in a Hotmoka Node](#installation-of-the-jar-in-a-hotmoka-node),
you will see that we have built a Hotmoka node from a remote service:

```java
RemoteNodeConfig config = new RemoteNodeConfig.Builder()
  .setURL("@server")
  .build();

try (Node node = RemoteNode.of(config)) {
  ...
}
```
The `RemoteNode.of(...)` method adapts a remote service into a Hotmoka node,
so that we can call all methods of that (Figure @fig:node_hierarchy).

By default, a remote node connects to a service by using the HTTP protocol, but
handles event notification by using web sockets. This is automatic and you do not need
to understand the details of this connection. It is possible to use web sockets for
*all* communications, also those of the many `get/add/post/run` methods of the
`Node` interface. For that, you can set a flag in the configuration of the remote node,
as follows:

```java
RemoteNodeConfig config = new RemoteNodeConfig.Builder()
  .setURL("@server")
  .setWebSockets(true)
  .build();
```

Nevertheless, there is currently no actual benefit in using web sockets for
all communications. Thus, we suggest to stick to the default configuration,
that uses web sockets only for event notification to the subscribed event handlers.

### Creating Sentry Nodes

We have seen that a `Node` can be published as a Hotmoka service:
on a machine `my.validator.com` we can execute:

```java
TendermintBlockchainConfig config = new TendermintBlockchainConfig.Builder().build();
ConsensusParams consensus = new ConsensusParams.Builder().build();
NodeServiceConfig serviceConfig = new NodeServiceConfig.Builder().build();

try (Node original = TendermintBlockchain.init(config, consensus);
     NodeService service = NodeService.of(serviceConfig, original)) {
  ...
}
```

The service will be available on the internet as

```url
http://my.validator.com:8080
```

Moreover, on another machine `my.sentry.com`,
that Hotmoka service can be adapted into a remote node
that, itself, can be published on that machine:

```java
NodeServiceConfig serviceConfig = new NodeServiceConfig.Builder().build();
RemoteNodeConfig config = new RemoteNodeConfig.Builder()
  .setURL("my.validator.com:8080")
  .build();

try (Node validator = RemoteNode.of(config);
     NodeService service = NodeService.of(serviceConfig, validator)) {
  ...
}
```

The service will be available at
```url
http://my.sentry.com:8080
```

We can continue this process as much as we want, but let us stop at this point.
Programmers can connect to the service published at
`http://my.sentry.com:8080` and send requests to it. That service is just a bridge
that forwards everything to the service at `http://my.validator.com:8080`.
It might not be immediately clear why this intermediate step could be useful
or desirable. The motivation is that we could keep the (precious) validator
machine under a firewall that allows connections with `my.sentry.com` only.
As a consequence, in case of DOS attacks, the sentry node will receive
the attack and possibly crash, while the validator continues to operate as usual:
it will continue to interact with the other validators and take part in the validation
of blocks. Moreover, since many sentries can be connected to a single validator, the latter
remains accessible through the other sentries, if needed.
This is an effective way to mitigate the problem of DOS attacks to validator nodes.

The idea of sentry nodes against DOS attacks is not new and is used, for
instance, in Cosmos networks [[Sentry]](#references).
However, note how it is easy, with Hotmoka,
to build such a network architecture by using network
services and remote nodes.

## Signatures and Quantum-Resistance

Hotmoka is agnostic wrt. the algorithm used for signing requests. This means that it is
possible to deploy Hotmoka nodes that sign requests with distinct signature algorithms.
Of course, if nodes must re-execute the same transactions, such as in the case of a
blockchain, then all nodes of the blockchain must use the same algorithm for
the transactions signed by each given account, or otherwise
they will not be able to reach consensus.
Yet, any algorithm can be chosen for the blockchain. In principle, it is even possible to use
an algorithm that does not sign the transactions, if the identity of the callers of the
transactions needn't be verified. However, this might be sensible in private networks only.

The default signature algorithm used by a node is specified at construction time, as a configuration
parameter. For instance, the code

```java
TendermintBlockchainConfig config = new TendermintBlockchainConfig.Builder()
                                      .signRequestsWith("ed25519")
                                      .build();

try (Node node = TendermintBlockchain.of(config, consensus)) {
  ...
}
```

starts a Tendermint-based blockchain node that uses the ed25519 signature algorithm
as default signature algorithm for the requests.
Requests sent to that node can be signed as follows:

```java
// recover the algorithm used by the node
SignatureAlgorithm<SignedTransactionRequest> signature
  = SignatureAlgorithmForTransactionRequests.mk
       (node.getNameOfSignatureAlgorithmForRequests());

// create a key pair for that algorithm
KeyPair keys = signature.getKeyPair();

// create a signer object with the private key of the key pair
Signer signer = Signer.with(signature, keys.getPrivate());

// create an account having public key keys.getPublic()
....

// create a transaction request on behalf of the account
ConstructorCallTransactionRequest request
  = new ConstructorCallTransactionRequest(signer, account, ...);

// send the request to the node
node.addConstructorCallTransaction(request);
```

In the example above, we have explicitly specified
to use ed25519 as default signature algorithm. That is what is chosen
if nothing is specified at configuration-time.
Consequently, there is no need to specify that algorithm in the
configuration object and that is why we never did it in the previous chapters.
It is possible to configure nodes with other default signature algorithms.
For instance:

```java
TendermintBlockchainConfig config = new TendermintBlockchainConfig.Builder()
                                      .signRequestsWith("sha256dsa")
                                      .build();
```

configures a node that uses sha256dsa as default signature algorithm, while

```java
TendermintBlockchainConfig config = new TendermintBlockchainConfig.Builder()
                                      .signRequestsWith("empty")
                                      .build();
```

configures a node that uses the empty signature as default signature algorithm; it is an
algorithm that accepts all signatures, in practice disabling any signature checking.

It is possible to specify a quantum-resistant signature algorithm as default,
that is, one that belongs to
a family of algorithms that are expected to be immune from attacks performed through
a quantistic computer. For instance,

```java
TendermintBlockchainConfig config = new TendermintBlockchainConfig.Builder()
                                      .signRequestsWith("qtesla1")
                                      .build();
```

configures a node that uses the quantum-resistant qtesla-p-I algorithm as default signature algorithm,
while

```java
TendermintBlockchainConfig config = new TendermintBlockchainConfig.Builder()
                                      .signRequestsWith("qtesla3")
                                      .build();
```

configures a node that uses the quantum-resistant qtesla-p-III
algorithm as default signature algorithm, that is expected to be more resistant than
qtesla-p-I but has larger signatures than qtesla-p-I.

Quantum-resistance is an important aspect of future-generation blockchains.
However, at the time of this writing, a quantum attack is mainly a theoretical
possibility, while the large size of quantum-resistant keys and signatures is
already a reality and a node using a qtesla signature algorithm _as default_
might exhaust the disk space of your computer very quickly. In practice, it is better
to use a quantum-resistant signature algorithm only for a subset of the transactions, whose
quantum-resistance is deemed important. Instead, one should use a lighter algorithm
(such as the default ed25519) for all other transactions. This is possible because
Hotmoka nodes allow one to mix transactions signed with distinct algorithms.
Namely, one can use ed25519 as default algorithm, for all transactions signed
by instances of `ExternallyOwnedAccount`s,
with the exception of those transactions that are signed by instances of
`AccountQTESLA1`, such as `ExternallyOwnedAccountQTESLA1`,
or of `AccountQTESLA3`, such as `ExternallOwnedAccountQTESLA3`,
or of `AccountSHA256DSA`, such as `ExternallOwnedAccountSHA256DSA`
(see Figure @fig:contract_hierarchy).
Namely, if the caller of a transaction is an `AccountQTESLA1`, then the
request of the transaction must be signed with the qtesla-p-I algorithm.
If the caller of a transaction is an `AccountQTESLA3`, then the
request of the transaction must be signed with the qtesla-p-III algorithm.
If the caller of a transaction is an `AccountSHA256DSA`, then the
request of the transaction must be signed with the sha256dsa algorithm.
If the caller of a transaction is an `AccountED25519`, then the
request of the transaction must be signed with the ed25519 algorithm.
In practice, this allows specific transactions to override the default signature
algorithm for the node.

For instance, let us create an account using the default signature algorithm for the node.
We charge its creation to the faucet of the node:

```shell
$ moka create-account 1000000000000 --payer faucet --url @server

Please specify the password of the new account: game
...
A new account @account4
has been created
```

You can check the class of the new account with the `moka state` command:

```shell
$ moka state @account4
    --url @server

...
class io.takamaka.code.lang.ExternallyOwnedAccountED25519 ...
  publicKey:java.lang.String =
    "@publickeyaccount4"
  balance:java.math.BigInteger = 1000000000000
...
```

As you can see, an account has been created, that uses the default `ed25519`
signature algorithm of the node.
Assume that we want to create an account now, that _always_ uses the `sha256dsa` signature algorithm,
regardless of the default signature algorithm of the node. We can specify that to `moka create-account`:

```shell
$ moka create-account 1000000000000
    --payer faucet --signature sha256dsa --url @server

Please specify the password of the new account: play
...
A new account @account5
has been created
```
This creation has been more expensive, because the public key of the
sha256dsa algorithm is much longer than that for the ed25519 algorithm.
You can verify this with the `moka state` command:

```shell
$ moka state @account5
    --url @server

...
class io.takamaka.code.lang.ExternallyOwnedAccountSHA256DSA ...
  publicKey:java.lang.String = "@short_publickeyaccount5"
  balance:java.math.BigInteger = 1000000000000000
  ...
```

Note that the class of the account is `ExternallyOwnedAccountSHA256DSA` this time.

Let us create an account that uses the qtesla-p-I signature algorithm now:

```
$ moka create-account 1000000000000
    --payer faucet --signature qtesla1 --url @server

Please specify the password of the new account: quantum1
...
Total gas consumed: 5294043
...
A new account @account6
has been created
```
The creation of this account has been very expensive, since quantum-resistant
keys are very large. Again, you can use the `moka state`
command to verify that it has class `ExternallyOwnedAccountQTESLA1`.

Finally, let us use the previous qtesla-p-I account to create a qtesla-p-III account:

```shell
$ moka create-account 100000
    --payer @account6
    --signature qtesla3 --url @server

Please specify the password of the payer account: quantum1
Please specify the password of the new account: quantum3
...
Total gas consumed: 5294170
...
A new account @account7
has been created
```

Note, again, the extremely high gas cost of this creation.

Regardless of the kind of account, their use it always the same.
The only difference is to use the right signature algorithm when signing
a transaction, since it must match that of the caller account. This is automatic, if we
use the `moka` tool. For instance, let us use our qtesla-p-I account to install
the `family-0.0.1.jar` code in the node:

```shell
$ cd hotmoka_tutorial
$ moka install family/target/family-0.0.1.jar
    --payer @account6
    --url @server

Please specify the password of the payer account: quantum1
Do you really want to spend up to 696900 gas units to install the jar [Y/N] Y
family/target/family-0.0.1.jar has been installed
at @family3_address
...
```

The `moka` tool has understood that the payer is an account that signs with the
qtesla-p-I algorithm and has signed the request accordingly.

# Code Verification

Code verification checks that code complies with some constraints, that should
guarantee that its execution does not run into errors. Modern programming
languages apply more or less extensive code verification, since this helps
programmers write reliable code. This can both occur at run time and at compile
time. Run-time (_dynamic_) code verification is typically stronger, since it can exploit
exact information on run-time values flowing through the code. However,
compile-time (_static_) code verification has the advantage that it runs only
once, at compilation time or at jar installation time, and can prove, once and for all,
that some errors will never occur, regardless of the execution path that will
be followed at run time.

Hotmoka nodes apply a combination of static and dynamic verification to the
Takamaka code that is installed inside their store.
Static verification runs only once, when a node installs
a jar in its store, or when classes are loaded for the first time
at run time.
Dynamic verification runs every time some piece of code gets executed.

## JVM Bytecode Verification

Takamaka code is written in Java, compiled into Java bytecode, instrumented
and run inside the Java Virtual Machine (_JVM_). Hence, all code verifications
executed by the JVM apply to Takamaka code as well. In particular, the JVM verifies
some structural and dynamic constraints of class files, including their
type correctness.
Moreover, the JVM executes run-time checks as well: for instance, class casts
are checked at run time, as well as pointer dereferences and
array stores. Violations result in exceptions. For a thorough discussion,
we refer the interested
reader to the official documentation about Java bytecode class
verification [[JVM-Verification]](#references).

## Takamaka Bytecode Verification

Hotmoka nodes verify extra constraints, that are not checked as part of the
standard JVM bytecode verification. Such extra constraints are mainly related to
the correct use of Takamaka annotations and contracts, and are
in part static and in part dynamic. Static constraints are checked when a
jar is installed into the store of a node, hence only once for each node of a network.
If a static constraint
is violated, the transaction that tries to install the jar fails with
an exception. Dynamic constraints, instead,
are checked every time a piece of code is run. If a dynamic constraint is
violated, the transaction that runs the code fails with an exception.

Below, remember that `@FromContract` is shorthand for `@FromContract(Contract.class)`.
Moreover, note that the constraints related
to overridden methods follow by Liskov's principle [[LiskovW94]](#references).

Hotmoka nodes verify the following static constraints:

1. The `@FromContract(C.class)` annotation is only applied to constructors of a
  (non-strict) subclass of `io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage` or to instance methods of a
  (non-strict) subclass of `io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage` or interface.
2. In every use of the `@FromContract(C.class)` annotation, class `C` is a subclass
  of the abstract class `io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract`.
3. If a method is annotated as `@FromContract(C.class)` and overrides another method,
  then the latter is annotated as `@FromContract(D.class)` as well, and `D` is a
  (non-strict) subclass of `C`.
4. If a method is annotated as `@FromContract(D.class)` and is overridden by another method,
  then the latter is annotated as `@FromContract(C.class)` as well, and `D` is a
  (non-strict) subclass of `C`.
5. If a method is annotated as `@Payable` or `@RedPayable`, then it is also annotated as
  `@FromContract(C.class)` for some `C`.
6. If a method is annotated as `@Payable` or `@RedPayable`, then it has a first formal argument
  (the paid amount) of type `int`, `long` or `BigInteger`.
7. If a method is annotated as `@Payable` and overrides another method,
  then the latter is annotated as `@Payable` as well; an identical rule holds
  for `@RedPayable`.
8. If a method is annotated as `@Payable` and is overridden by another method,
  then the latter is annotated as `@Payable` as well; an identical rule
  holds for `@RedPayable`.
9. No method or constructor is annotated with both `@Payable` and `@RedPayable`.
10. The `@Payable` annotation is only applied to constructors of a (non-strict) subclass of
  `io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract` or to instance methods of a (non-strict) subclass of
  `io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract` or interface.
11. The `@RedPayable` annotation is only applied to constructors of a (non-strict) subclass of
  `io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract` or to instance methods of a (non-strict) subclass of
  `io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract` or interface.
12. Classes that extend `io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage` have instance non-transient
  fields whose type
  is primitive (`char`, `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`,
  `double` or `boolean`), or is a class that extends `io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage`,
  or is an `enum` without instance non-transient fields, or is any of
  `java.math.BigInteger`, `java.lang.String`, `java.lang.Object` or an interface
  (see [Storage Types and Constraints on Storage Classes](#storage-types-and-constraints-on-storage-classes)).

14. There are no finalizers.

> A finalizer is a method declared exactly as
> `public void finalize() { ... }`. It might be called

15. Calls to `caller()` occur only inside `@FromContract` constructors or methods
    and on `this`.
16. Calls to constructors or methods annotated as `@FromContract` occur
    only in constructors or instance methods of an
    `io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract`; moreover, if they occur, syntactically,
    on `this`, then they occur in a method or constructor that is itself
    annotated as `@FromContract` (since the `caller()` is preserved in that case).
17. Bytecodes `jsr`, `ret` and `putstatic` are not used; inside constructors and instance
    methods, bytecodes `astore 0`, `istore 0`, `lstore 0`, `dstore 0` and
    `fstore 0` are not used.

> Local variable 0 is used to hold the `this` reference. Forbidding its modification

> in Java but perfectly legal in (unexpected) Java bytecode.
> The guarantee that `this` is not reassigned is needed, in turn, for
> checking properties such as point 15 above.

18. There are no exception handlers that may catch
    unchecked exceptions (that is,
    instances of `java.lang.RuntimeException` or of `java.lang.Error`).

> By forbidding exception handlers for unchecked exceptions, it follows that
> unchecked exceptions will always make a transaction fail: all object
> updates up to the exception will be discarded. In practice,

> Consider for instance the following (illegal) code:

> try {
>   this.list.add(x);
>   x.flagAsInList();
>   this.counter++;
> }
> catch (Exception e) { // illegal in Takamaka
> }
> ```
> Here, the programmer might expect that
> the size of `this.list` is `this.counter` and the correctness of his code might
> be based on that invariant. However, if `x` holds
> `null`, an unchecked `NullPointerException` is raised just before
> `this.counter` could be incremented, it would be caught and ignored.
> The expected invariant would be lost.
> The contract will remain in blockchain in an inconsistent state,

> reach the `flagAsInList()` call, and leave the contract in an inconsistent
> state. Checked exceptions, instead, are explicitly checked by the
> compiler, which should ring a bell in the head of the programmer.
>
> For a more dangerous example, consider the following Java bytecode:
>
> ```
> 10: goto 10
> exception handler for java.lang.Exception: 10 11 10 // illegal in Takamaka
> ```
>
> This Java bytecode exception handler entails that any `OutOfGasError`
> thrown by an instruction from line 10 (included) to line 11 (excluded)
> redirects control to line 10. Hence, this code will exhaust the gas by looping at line
> 10. Once all gas is consumed, an `OutOfGasError` is thrown, that is redirected
> to line 10. Hence another `OutOfGasError` will occur, that redirects the
> executor to line 10, again. And so on, for ever. That is, this code
> disables the guarantee that Takamaka transactions always terminate,
> possibly with an `OutOfGasError`. This code could be used for
> a DOS attack to a Hotmoka node. Although this code cannot be written in Java,
> it is well possible to write it directly, with a bytecode editor,
> and submit it to a Hotmoka node, that will reject it, thanks to point 19.

19. If a method or constructor is annotated as `@ThrowsException`, then it is public.
20. If a method is annotated as `@ThrowsException` and overrides another method,
    then the latter is annotated as `@ThrowsException` as well.
21. If a method is annotated as `@ThrowsException` and is overridden by another method,
    then the latter is annotated as `@ThrowsException` as well.
22. Classes installed in a node are not in packages `java.*`, `javax.*`
    or `io.takamaka.code.*`; packages starting with `io.takamaka.code.*` are
    however allowed if the node is not initialized yet.

> The goal of the previous constraint is to make it impossible to change
> the semantics of the Java or Takamaka runtime. For instance, it is not
> possible to replace class `io.takamaka.code.lang.Contract`, which could thoroughly
> revolutionize the execution of the contracts. During the initialization of a node,
> that occurs once at its start-up, it is however permitted to install the
> runtime of Takamaka (the `io-takamaka-code-@hotmoka_version.jar` archive used in the examples
> in the previous chapters).

23. All referenced classes, constructors, methods and fields must be white-listed.
    Those from classes installed in the store of the node are always white-listed by
    default. Other classes loaded from the Java class path must have been explicitly
    marked as white-listed in the `io-takamaka-code-whitelisting-@hotmoka_version.jar` archive.

> Hence, for instance, the classes of the support library `io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage`
> and `io.takamaka.code.lang.Takamaka` are white-listed, since they
> are inside `io-takamaka-code-@hotmoka_version.jar`, that is typically installed in the store of a
> node during its initialization. Classes from user
> jars installed in the node are similarly white-listed.
> Method `java.lang.System.currentTimeMillis()` is not white-listed,
> since it is loaded from the Java class path and is not annotated as white-listed
> in `io-takamaka-code-whitelisting-@hotmoka_version.jar`.

24. Bootstrap methods for the `invokedynamic` bytecode use only standard call-site
    resolvers, namely, instances of `java.lang.invoke.LambdaMetafactory.metafactory`
    or of `java.lang.invoke.StringConcatFactory.makeConcatWithConstants`.

> This condition is needed since other call-site resolvers could call any
> method, depending on their algorithmic implementation, actually
> side-stepping the white-listing constraints imposed by point 24.
> Java compilers currently do not generate other call-site resolvers.

25. There are no native methods.
26. There are no `synchronized` methods, nor `synchronized` blocks.

> Takamaka code is single-threaded, to enforce its determinism.
> Hence, there is no need to use the `synchronized` keyword.

27. Field and method names do not start with a special prefix used
    for instrumentation, namely they do not start with `§`.

> This condition avoids name clashes after instrumentation.
> That prefix is not legal in Java, hence this constraint
> does not interfere with programmers. However, it could be used
> in (unexpected) Java bytecode, that would be rejected thanks to point 27.

28. Packages are not split across different jars in the classpath.

> This condition makes it impossible to call `protected` methods
> outside of subclasses and of the same jar where they are defined.
> Split packages allow an attacker to define a new jar
> with the same package name as classes in another jar and
> call the `protected` methods of objects of those classes.
> This is dangerous since `protected` methods
> often access or modify sensitive fields of the objects.

Takamaka verifies the following dynamic constraints:

1. Every `@Payable` or `@RedPayable` constructor or method is passed a non-`null` and
   non-negative amount of funds.
2. A call to a `@Payable` or `@RedPayable` constructor or method succeeds only if the caller
   has enough funds to pay for the call (ie., the amount first parameter of
   the method or constructor).
3. A call to a `@FromContract(C.class)` constructor or method succeeds only if
   the caller is an instance of `C`.
4. A bytecode instruction is executed only if there is enough gas for
   its execution.
5. White-listed methods or constructors with white-listing proof obligations
   are only executed if such proof obligations are satisfied.
6. Non-transient fields of type `java.lang.Object` or of type interface,
   belonging to some storage object reachable from the actual parameters of a transaction
   at the end of the transaction, contain `null` or a storage object.

## Command-Line Verification and Instrumentation

__[See project `family_wrong` inside the `hotmoka_tutorial` repository]__

If a jar being installed in a Hotmoka node does not satisfy the static
constraints that we have described before, the installation transaction fails with
a verification exception, no jar is actually installed but the gas of the
caller gets consumed. Hence it is not practical to realize that a
static constraint does not hold only by trying to install a jar in a node.
Instead, it is desirable to verify all constraints off-line, fix all
violations (if any) and only then install the jar in the node. This is
possible by using the `moka` command-line interface of Hotmoka.
Namely, it provides a subcommand that performs the same identical jar
verification that would be executed when a jar is
installed in a Hotmoka node.

Create a `family_wrong-0.0.1.jar` containing
a wrong version of the `family` project. For that, copy the `family`
project into `family_wrong`, change the artifact name in its `pom.xml` into
`family_wrong` and modify its `Person` class so that it contains
a few errors, as follows:

```java
package io.takamaka.family;

import io.takamaka.code.lang.Exported;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.Payable;
import io.takamaka.code.lang.Storage;

@Exported
public class Person extends Storage {
  private final String name;
  private final int day;
  private final int month;
  private final int year;

  // error: arrays are not allowed in storage
  public final Person[] parents = new Person[2];

  public static int toStringCounter;

  public Person(String name, int day, int month, int year,
                Person parent1, Person parent2) {

    this.name = name;
    this.day = day;
    this.month = month;
    this.year = year;
    this.parents[0] = parent1;
    this.parents[1] = parent2;
  }

  // error: @Payable without @FromContract, missing amount and is not in Contract
  public @Payable Person(String name, int day, int month, int year) {
    this(name, day, month, year, null, null);
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    toStringCounter++; // error (line 37): static update (putstatic) is now allowed
    return name +" (" + day + "/" + month + "/" + year + ")";
  }
}
```

Then generate the `family_wrong-0.0.1.jar` file:

```shell
$ cd family_wrong
$ mvn package
```

Let us start with the verification of `io-takamaka-code-@hotmoka_version.jar`,
taken from Maven's cache:

```shell
$ cd hotmoka_tutorial
$ moka verify
    ~/.m2/repository/io/hotmoka/io-takamaka-code/@hotmoka_version/io-takamaka-code-@hotmoka_version.jar
    --init
Verification succeeded
```
No error has been issued, since the code does not violate any static constraint.
Note that we used the `--init` switch, since otherwise we would get many errors
related to the use of the forbidden `io.takamaka.code.*` package. With that
switch, we verify the jar as it would be verified before node initialization,
that is, by considering such packages as legal.

We can generate the instrumented jar, exactly as it would be generated during
installation in a Hotmoka node. For that, we run:

```shell
$ mkdir instrumented
$ moka instrument
    ~/.m2/repository/io/hotmoka/io-takamaka-code/@hotmoka_version/io-takamaka-code-@hotmoka_version.jar
    instrumented/io-takamaka-code-@hotmoka_version.jar
    --init
```

The `moka instrument` command verifies and instruments the jar, and then stores
its instrumented version inside the `instrumented` directory.

Let us verify and instrument `family-0.0.1.jar` now. As all Takamaka programs,
it uses classes from the `io-takamaka-code` jar,
hence it depends on it. We specify this with the `--libs` option, that must
refer to an already instrumented jar:

```shell
$ moka instrument
    family/target/family-0.0.1.jar
    instrumented/family-0.0.1.jar
    --libs instrumented/io-takamaka-code-@hotmoka_version.jar
```
Verification succeeds this time as well, and an instrumented `family-0.0.1.jar` appears in the
`instrumented` directory. Note that we have not used the `--init` switch this time, since we
wanted to simulate the verification as it would occur after the node has been already initialized,
when users add their jars to the store of the node.

Let us verify the `family_wrong-0.0.1.jar` archive now, that
(we know) contains a few errors. This time, verification will fail and the errors will
be printed on the screen:
```shell
$ moka verify
    family_wrong/target/family_wrong-0.0.1.jar
    --libs instrumented/io-takamaka-code-@hotmoka_version.jar 

io/takamaka/family/Person.java field parents:
  type not allowed for a field of a storage class
io/takamaka/family/Person.java method <init>:
  @Payable can only be used in contracts or interfaces
io/takamaka/family/Person.java method <init>:
  a @Payable method must have a first argument for the paid amount,
  of type int, long or BigInteger
io/takamaka/family/Person.java method <init>:
  @Payable can only be applied to a @FromContract method or constructor
io/takamaka/family/Person.java:55:
  static fields cannot be updated

Verification failed because of errors
```

The same failure occurs with the `instrument` command, that will not generate the instrumented jar:
```shell
$ moka instrument
    family_wrong/target/family_wrong-0.0.1.jar
    instrumented/family_wrong-0.0.1.jar
    --libs instrumented/io-takamaka-code-@hotmoka_version.jar

io/takamaka/family/Person.java field parents:
  type not allowed for a field of a storage class
io/takamaka/family/Person.java method <init>:
  @Payable can only be used in contracts or interfaces
io/takamaka/family/Person.java method <init>:
  a @Payable method must have a first argument for the paid amount,
  of type int, long or BigInteger
io/takamaka/family/Person.java method <init>:
  @Payable can only be applied to a @FromContract method or constructor
io/takamaka/family/Person.java:55:
  static fields cannot be updated

Verification failed because of errors, no instrumented jar was generated
```
